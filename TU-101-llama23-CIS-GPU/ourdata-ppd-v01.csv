"1 Digital Screening for Mental Health in Pregnancy and Postpartum: A Systematic Review The primary objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of digital screening for mental health issues, specifically anxiety and depression, in pregnant and postpartum women. Additionally, the review aimed to identify barriers and enablers to the implementation of digital mental health screening within the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The review addresses the challenge of accurately identifying and managing mental health issues in pregnant and postpartum women. Traditional screening methods, such as paper-based assessments and clinician-administered evaluations, may not be as efficient or accessible. The study explores whether digital screening tools can overcome these limitations and provide a viable alternative for early detection and intervention. The systematic review included a total of 34 full-text articles. These studies varied in their sample sizes, study designs, and geographical locations, providing a broad overview of the current state of digital mental health screening in maternal care. The review encompassed various study designs including systematic reviews, longitudinal cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, qualitative studies, evaluations, medical records audits, administrative data analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and before-and-after studies. The inclusion criteria were comprehensive to cover a wide range of research methodologies and ensure robust conclusions. The review followed a structured approach to study selection and data extraction. One author independently assessed titles, abstracts, keywords, and full texts against predefined criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with second reviewers to achieve consensus. Data extraction included details on study characteristics, digital modes used, methodological approaches, and outcomes measured. The risk of bias was assessed using templates appropriate for the included study designs. The review found that digital screening tools were generally acceptable and feasible for both healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients. Digital tools demonstrated potential effectiveness in identifying symptoms of depression and anxiety, leading to appropriate referrals. However, the effectiveness varied across different settings and populations. The studies highlighted various barriers (e.g., technological access, user-friendliness) and enablers (e.g., quicker administration, reduced error) for implementing digital screening. The review noted several limitations, including the heterogeneity of study designs and populations, which made it difficult to generalize findings. Some studies had moderate to high risk of bias, and there was limited information on long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the review relied on studies published after the year 2000, which may have excluded relevant earlier research.","Digital screening for mental health in pregnancy and postpartum shows promise in terms of acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness. The review recommends integrating digital tools into routine maternal care to enhance early detection and management of mental health issues. However, further research is needed to address the identified limitations and to evaluate the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of these digital interventions ."
"2 Effect of Immediate Referral vs a Brief Problem-solving Intervention for Screen-Detected Peripartum Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial The primary objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two strategies for the initial management of screen-detected peripartum depressive symptoms: immediate referral using engagement-focused care coordination (EFCC) and a brief problem-solving education (PSE) intervention. The study addresses the challenge of ensuring appropriate care for pregnant and postpartum persons who screen positive for depression. Traditional referral processes may not effectively engage this population, leading to untreated depressive symptoms. The study seeks to determine whether immediate referral or an on-site cognitive-behavioral intervention is more effective in managing peripartum depression. The study included 230 pregnant and postpartum participants who had positive depression screen results. Participants were randomized into two groups: EFCC (115 participants) and PSE (115 participants). This study was a randomized comparative effectiveness trial conducted from February 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020. It was performed at an urban safety-net hospital's prenatal clinic, postpartum unit, and pediatric clinic. The trial followed a parallel group design with stratified, blocked randomization. Participants were recruited and screened using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. They were randomly assigned to either the EFCC group, which received referrals to mental health services after an engagement session, or the PSE group, which received a brief cognitive-behavioral program on-site. Data collection included baseline demographic information, depressive and anxiety symptoms assessed at bi-monthly intervals over 12 months, and engagement with mental health care. Statistical analyses involved intention-to-treat comparisons using negative binomial regression and generalized estimating equations. Depressive Symptoms: Both EFCC and PSE groups experienced reductions in depressive symptoms. The mean number of moderately severe depressive symptom episodes was similar between groups (EFCC: 2.2, PSE: 2.2). However, a significant treatment Ã— time interaction suggested a more favorable symptom trajectory in the EFCC group. Anxiety Symptoms: Reductions in anxiety symptoms were observed in both groups, with no significant differences in the number of anxiety symptom elevations between EFCC and PSE. Engagement with Care: No significant differences were found in engagement or retention with mental health services between the two groups. The study had several limitations: Suboptimal intervention uptake, particularly in the EFCC group. Lack of an ability to explain underlying mechanisms for differential symptom trajectories. Conducting the study within a single medical center limits generalizability. Absence of a usual care group precluded definitive conclusions about the superiority of either intervention compared to usual care.","The study found no significant differences in depressive or anxiety symptom burden between the two intervention strategies over 12 months. However, immediate referral (EFCC) showed a more favorable depressive symptom trajectory compared to on-site problem-solving education (PSE). Further research is needed to optimize post-screening depression care strategies for peripartum persons, particularly in low-income and minority populations. Immediate referral using engagement-focused care coordination may be a viable approach for managing screen-detected peripartum depression."
"3 Be a Mom, a Web-Based Intervention to Prevent Postpartum Depression: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of ""Be a Mom,"" a web-based intervention designed to prevent postpartum depression (PPD). Postpartum depression is a significant public health issue that affects many women after childbirth, leading to adverse outcomes for both mothers and their children. Traditional face-to-face interventions have limitations in accessibility and reach. Therefore, there is a need for scalable and accessible preventive interventions that can effectively reduce the risk of PPD. The pilot study included 39 postpartum women, who were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (20 participants) or the control group (19 participants). This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention group, receiving the Be a Mom program, or the control group, receiving standard care. Participants were recruited through social media and healthcare services. Those eligible were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention consisted of a web-based program offering psychoeducational content, cognitive-behavioral strategies, and emotional regulation techniques over eight weeks. The primary outcomes measured were depressive symptoms, anxiety, and maternal self-efficacy, assessed using validated questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and anxiety levels compared to the control group. The intervention was well-received, with high levels of engagement and satisfaction reported by participants. Preliminary efficacy data suggested that the Be a Mom program could be an effective tool for preventing PPD. The study had a small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the short follow-up period (three months) may not capture the long-term effects of the intervention. The reliance on self-reported measures could also introduce response biases.","The Be a Mom web-based intervention demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms and anxiety among postpartum women. These findings support the potential of digital interventions to address PPD and highlight the need for larger trials with longer follow-up periods to confirm these results."
"4 Effects of a Psychological Nursing Intervention on Prevention of Anxiety and Depression in the Postpartum Period: A Randomized Controlled Trial The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral intervention combined with routine postpartum care in preventing postpartum anxiety and depression among primiparous women. Postpartum depression and anxiety are common psychological issues that affect new mothers, leading to detrimental effects on both maternal and infant health. Despite routine postpartum care, there is a significant need for effective interventions to prevent the onset of these conditions. The study initially recruited 843 primiparous women, but after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 260 participants remained. These participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=130) or the control group (n=130). This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at Cangzhou Central Hospital. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either routine postpartum care or a combination of routine postpartum care and cognitive behavioral intervention. Participants in the intervention group received routine postpartum care plus a 6-week cognitive behavioral intervention, which included psychological evaluation, establishment of a self-activity plan, mental health care, postpartum care enhancement, and family support enhancement. The control group received only routine postpartum care. Assessments were conducted using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) before and after the intervention. The study found significant reductions in the post-intervention scores of HAMA, HAMD, EPDS, and PSQI in the intervention group compared to baseline (p=0.034, p=0.038, p=0.004, p=0.014, respectively). The incidence of postpartum depression was significantly lower in the intervention group (11.5%) compared to the control group (24.3%). Additionally, participants in the intervention group reported higher satisfaction with care (p=0.032). The study had several limitations: The use of HAMD, HAMA, and EPDS as screening tools rather than diagnostic parameters for anxiety and depression. The short follow-up period of only six weeks. The lack of tracking for actual time spent on home practice activities in the intervention group. Possible bias due to self-reported measures.",The study provided evidence that cognitive behavioral intervention combined with routine postpartum care effectively alleviates anxiety and depression in primiparous women and inhibits the pathogenesis of postpartum depression. The findings suggest that integrating cognitive behavioral techniques into postpartum care can enhance psychological well-being and improve satisfaction with care among new mothers.
"5 Mobile Health for Perinatal Depression and Anxiety: A Scoping Review The objective of this scoping review was to summarize the extent, range, and nature of academic literature about the use of mHealth tools for the prevention, screening, and treatment of perinatal depression and anxiety. The aim was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of mHealth tools to support women with perinatal depression or anxiety and to identify gaps in knowledge and practice to inform future workâ€‹â€‹. Given the high rate of comorbidities and similar treatment options for perinatal depression and anxiety, there is a need for a comprehensive understanding of the current state of mHealth tools. This understanding is essential to inform potential future work in the field. However, such an understanding does not yet existâ€‹â€‹. The initial search yielded 673 results, with an additional 78 records retrieved in a search update. After removing duplicates, 477 publications were reviewed. Based on title and abstract, 396 articles were excluded. After full-text review, 26 publications (22 papers and 4 conference abstracts) describing 22 unique studies were included in this reviewâ€‹â€‹. A scoping review framework defined by Arksey and Oâ€™Malley and further developed by Levac et al. was used for this study. The scoping review approach was chosen as it was the most appropriate for assessing the breadth of the literature and identifying gaps and opportunities for further work in this fieldâ€‹â€‹. Four databases (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus) were searched for terms related to mobile phones, the perinatal period (pregnancy, postpartum, antenatal, and maternal), and depression or anxiety. The search strategy was reviewed by a librarian specializing in systematic and scoping review search strategies. Rayyan, a web-based platform designed for data management for systematic reviews, was used to manage citations and filter results. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied iteratively during the screening process, and data abstraction was conducted independently by two reviewersâ€‹â€‹. Overall, 26 publications describing 22 unique studies were included in the review. Studies varied by the type of technology used (e.g., SMS or app), purpose of the tool (e.g., prevention, screening, or treatment), illness (depression or anxiety), and time point (pregnancy and/or postpartum). The interventions were delivered either during pregnancy or in the postpartum period, with some designed to be used during both periodsâ€‹â€‹. The review included studies published only in English and after 2007, reflecting the upsurge in publications on mHealth following the introduction of the Apple iPhone. Resource limitations for translations and the restriction to peer-reviewed journals also limited the scope. Additionally, the variability in study designs, interventions, and outcome measures across the included studies posed challenges for drawing definitive conclusionsâ€‹â€‹.","The scoping review highlighted the growing interest and potential of mHealth tools in addressing perinatal depression and anxiety. Future work should incorporate active psychological treatment, address continuity of care across the perinatal period, and consider clinical sustainability to fully realize the potential of mHealth interventionsâ€‹â€‹."
"6 Effectiveness of Interventions to Prevent Perinatal Depression: An Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses The primary objective of this umbrella review was to summarize and compare the evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SR&MA) examining the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at preventing perinatal depression. Perinatal depression is the most common psychiatric condition during the perinatal period, affecting approximately 12% of women globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has doubled this rate. Untreated perinatal depression has severe consequences for mothers, their partners, and their children, and poses a significant economic burden on society. Despite the availability of numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the effectiveness of preventive interventions remains inconclusive, necessitating a higher level of evidence synthesisâ€‹â€‹. The umbrella review included a total of 19 SRs and MAs, evaluating 152 unique randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 83,408 women from 26 countries and five continentsâ€‹â€‹. This study was an umbrella review of SR&MA of RCTs. It aimed to provide a high-level synthesis of the evidence on the effectiveness of preventive interventions for perinatal depression. The review included studies published up to December 2022. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Collaborationâ€™s Guideline for overviews of reviews. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020173125)â€‹â€‹ Four databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and OpenGrey) were searched. Studies were included if they met the criteria of involving women during the perinatal period without a current diagnosis of depression, examined preventive interventions, used RCT designs, and reported outcomes related to the prevention of perinatal depression. Data were extracted and synthesized using a random effects model, and the quality of the included SR&MA was assessed using AMSTAR-2 and the GRADE systemâ€‹â€‹. Overall Effectiveness: The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) for any intervention was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.20 to 0.38), indicating a small but statistically significant effect on reducing perinatal depressive symptoms. Types of Interventions: 1. Exercise/physical activity-based interventions had a median effect size of 0.43. 2. Psychological interventions had a median effect size of 0.28. 3. Combined interventions had a median effect size of 0.36. 4. Dietary supplements and pharmacological interventions showed insufficient evidence for effectiveness. 5. Quality of Evidence: According to AMSTAR-2, 79% of the included SR&MA were rated as low or critically low quality. The strength of evidence, according to GRADE, was generally lowâ€‹â€‹. The methodological quality of most included SR&MA was low, with many lacking critical details such as lists of excluded studies and discussions on the impact of risk of bias. The overall quality of evidence was low, with insufficient reporting on GRADE assessments in many cases. The review included studies from predominantly high-income countries, limiting generalizability to diverse populations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The inclusion of women with baseline depression in many studies made it difficult to distinguish between prevention and treatment effects. The degree of overlap among RCTs was slight, but the overlap in some categories (e.g., exercise-based interventions) was high, potentially skewing resultsâ€‹â€‹.","Exercise/physical activity-based and psychological interventions have a small-to-medium effect on reducing perinatal depressive symptoms. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude the effectiveness of dietary supplements and pharmacological interventions. High-quality SR&MA focusing on universal preventive interventions are needed. Implementing effective preventive strategies for perinatal depression in healthcare systems could significantly improve maternal mental health and reduce the societal burden of untreated perinatal depression"
"7 Leading the Charge Toward a World Without Depression: Perinatal Depression Can Be Prevented The objective of this review article was to provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence supporting the prevention of perinatal depression (PD) and to advocate for the implementation and scaling of known preventive interventions to reduce the prevalence of PD globally Perinatal depression is a common and severe mental health issue affecting mothers, which can have lasting negative impacts on both mothers and their children. Despite substantial progress in understanding and treating depression, there remains a critical need for effective preventive measures to address this widespread problem. The article highlights the existing evidence that shows PD can be prevented and discusses how digital tools can help disseminate these interventions widely. The review did not focus on a single sample size but rather included a comprehensive examination of multiple studies and meta-analyses. Specifically, it referenced data from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, which together encompass thousands of participants across different studies. This article is a review that synthesizes findings from a variety of study designs, including RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. It draws on a wide range of research conducted over the past 50 years to provide an overarching perspective on the prevention of perinatal depression. The review involved a thorough examination of existing literature on the prevention of perinatal depression, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Key interventions discussed include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) based programs like the Mothers and Babies Course (MBC), and the Reach Out, Stand Strong, Essentials for new mothers (ROSE) program. The article also discusses the US Preventive Services Task Force's (USPSTF) recommendations for routine referrals to preventive interventions for those at risk. Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions: a. The review highlights significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of preventive interventions for perinatal depression. Notably, counseling interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence of depression by approximately 39%. b. Mothers and Babies Course (MBC): This program, based on CBT principles, has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of perinatal depression by 53% in high-risk populations. c. Digital Interventions: The article discusses the potential of digital tools to enhance the accessibility and dissemination of preventive interventions. Digital versions of the MBC, such as online courses and SMS-based programs, have shown promising results in reaching diverse populations. a. Generalizability: While the reviewed interventions show promise, the generalizability of the findings may be limited due to variations in study populations and settings. b. Implementation Challenges: Scaling up these interventions to a global level involves logistical and practical challenges, including the need for cultural adaptation and training of facilitators. c. Long-term Impact: The review calls for more research on the long-term impact of preventive interventions and their effectiveness across different socio-economic and cultural contexts.","The review concludes that we now have sufficient evidence to prevent approximately half of all perinatal depression cases through known interventions. The authors advocate for the widespread implementation of these interventions and the use of digital tools to enhance their reach and effectiveness. They call for the MarcÃ© Society and the broader maternal mental health field to lead efforts in scaling up preventive interventions globally, with a focus on implementation, scalability, and sustainability. The review underscores the importance of continuing research to address the remaining cases of perinatal depression and highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to tackle broader social determinants of health that contribute to mental health disparities."
"8 Problem-Solving Treatment and Coping Styles in Primary Care for Minor Depression The primary objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Problem-Solving Treatment for Primary Care (PST-PC) to usual care (UC) for minor depression. Additionally, the study aimed to investigate whether the effectiveness of PST-PC was moderated by individual differences in coping styles. Minor depression is a prevalent condition in primary care, characterized by a sustained depressed mood without the full syndrome of major depressive disorder. It is four times more common than major depression in primary care settings and is often associated with significant functional impairment. Despite its prevalence, there is limited evidence supporting the clinical benefits of antidepressants or structured psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for minor depression. Given the nature of minor depression, which is often a reaction to life stresses, coping interventions like problem-solving therapies could be ideal treatments. The study initially screened 12,486 patients, of which 512 were referred for the study. Out of these, 283 were successfully contacted and scheduled for evaluation, and 227 completed the evaluation. Ultimately, 141 participants met the eligibility criteria and were randomized into the study: 72 to the PST-PC group and 69 to the UC group. This study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in two academic primary care clinics. Participants were randomly assigned to either the PST-PC or UC group. PST-PC is a six-session manual-based psychosocial skills intervention designed to be delivered over nine weeks. UC consisted of usual primary care practices, which included the option of discussing treatment options with primary care clinicians and possibly receiving prescriptions for antidepressants or referrals to mental health services. Participants were evaluated using several measures, including the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hopkins Symptom Checklist 20-item Depression Scale (HSCL-d-20), Brief COPE, and Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 (SF-36). The primary outcome measures were depressive symptoms assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, end of treatment, and six-month follow-up. Linear mixed modeling was used to analyze the data, considering time as a repeated factor and treatment and coping styles as fixed factors. The study found that participants in the PST-PC group improved more rapidly in depressive symptoms compared to those in the UC group. Specifically, those with high levels of avoidant coping showed the most significant improvement with PST-PC, which persisted for at least six months post-treatment. There was a significant interaction between time, treatment, and avoidant coping, indicating that PST-PC was particularly effective for individuals with high avoidant coping styles. Participants using problem-focused coping and social support also showed varying rates of improvement, but these effects were less pronounced than those for avoidant coping. The study had several limitations, including a sample that was predominantly Caucasian, well-educated, and with higher incomes, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The imbalance in the number of treatment contacts between the PST-PC and UC groups could also have influenced the results. Additionally, the reliability of the avoidant coping scale was slightly below the acceptable level, which could have introduced measurement error.","The study concluded that PST-PC is an effective treatment for minor depression in primary care, particularly for patients with high avoidant coping styles. The results support the hypothesis that PST-PC can compensate for the deficits associated with avoidant coping and suggest that more careful diagnosis and treatment matching based on coping styles may enhance treatment outcomes for minor depression in primary care settings. The findings advocate for the integration of problem-solving interventions into primary care to better address the needs of patients with minor depression."
"9 Perinatal Depression Screening Using Smartphone Technology: Exploring Uptake, Engagement, and Future Directions for the MGH Perinatal Depression Scale (MGHPDS) The primary objective of this study was to explore the potential for smartphone technology to screen for perinatal depression using the MGH Perinatal Depression Scale (MGHPDS). The study aimed to assess the app's reach, engagement, user demographics, and mental health symptoms among a diverse group of perinatal women. Perinatal depression is a common and severe mental health issue affecting women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. If untreated, it can lead to significant adverse outcomes for both mothers and their children. Traditional screening methods for perinatal depression often lack the reach and engagement needed to identify and support all affected women, particularly those in low-resource settings. There is a need for scalable and accessible tools to detect depression early and connect women to necessary treatments. The study analyzed data from 786 participants who met the inclusion criteria. These participants included women who were pregnant or up to 12 months postpartum and who had completed at least one assessment using the MGHPDS app. This study was a pilot research project involving the deployment of a smartphone application designed to screen for perinatal depression. The study utilized mainly passive recruitment methods and collected cross-sectional mental health data from women across over 30 countries. Participants completed various standardized questionnaires through the app to assess mood, anxiety, sleep, and perceived stress. Participants were recruited from the Departments of Psychiatry, Primary Care, Obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and affiliated community health centers. Additional recruitment was conducted through the hospital's website, flyers, brochures, emails, and presentations at national meetings. Inclusion criteria required participants to be pregnant or up to 12 months postpartum, aged 18-45, able to provide informed consent, and willing to complete questionnaires via the app. The primary outcome measure was the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), supplemented by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Data were collected at multiple time points and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The app successfully reached and engaged over 700 women from diverse geographical locations. Over half of the pregnant women (51%) and nearly three-quarters of postpartum women (71.7%) scored above the threshold for probable depression on the EPDS. The findings indicated high levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and perceived stress among the participants. The use of smartphone technology demonstrated the potential to collect large-scale, granular data on perinatal mental health and highlighted the app's feasibility as a screening tool in both high-resource and low-resource settings. The study faced several limitations, including potential selection bias, as women experiencing more severe symptoms may have been more likely to seek out and engage with the app. The cross-sectional nature of the data limited the ability to assess changes over time. Additionally, the study relied on self-reported measures, which may be subject to reporting biases. The relatively low engagement for longitudinal data collection suggested a need for strategies to improve participant retention and repeated use of the app.","The study demonstrated that smartphone technology could be an effective tool for screening perinatal depression on a global scale. The MGHPDS app showed promise in reaching a large and diverse sample of women, identifying those at risk for depression, and providing a foundation for connecting users to mental health resources. Future research should focus on enhancing user engagement over time, validating the screening tool with structured diagnostic interviews, and exploring the integration of digital therapeutics into the app. Leveraging digital technology could significantly improve the detection and treatment of perinatal depression, particularly in resource-limited settings, and help bridge the gap in mental health care for women worldwide."
"10 Interventions to Prevent Perinatal Depression: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement The primary objective of this recommendation statement is to issue a new guidance from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on interventions designed to prevent perinatal depression in pregnant or postpartum women. This includes evaluating the benefits and harms of various preventive measures and providing clinical recommendations based on the evidence. Perinatal depression, defined as the occurrence of a depressive disorder during pregnancy or following childbirth, affects approximately one in seven women, making it one of the most common complications associated with pregnancy and the postpartum period. Untreated perinatal depression can lead to significant adverse short- and long-term effects on both the mother and child, including increased risk of suicide, negative maternal behaviors, and impaired child development. The evidence review included 50 good- or fair-quality studies, comprising 49 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and one nonrandomized controlled intervention study. These studies involved a total of 19,000 participants, with 26 targeting pregnant women and 22 focusing on postpartum women. This recommendation statement is based on an umbrella review of existing literature, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The studies reviewed varied in design, but most were randomized controlled trials. The review covered a range of preventive interventions, including counseling, health system interventions, physical activity, education, supportive interventions, and pharmacological approaches. The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to evaluate the potential benefits and harms of preventive interventions for perinatal depression. The review focused on pregnant and postpartum women, excluding those with a current diagnosis of depression. The interventions assessed included cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), physical activity programs, educational and supportive interventions, and pharmacotherapy. Data were extracted and analyzed using standardized methods to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in preventing perinatal depression. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that counseling interventions, such as CBT and IPT, are effective in preventing perinatal depression among women at increased risk. These interventions showed a 39% reduction in the likelihood of developing perinatal depression, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 0.61. The counseling interventions were particularly effective for women with a history of depression, current depressive symptoms, or socioeconomic risk factors. The evidence for other interventions, such as physical activity, education, and pharmacotherapy, was limited or mixed. For example, physical activity programs showed some promise but did not consistently demonstrate significant reductions in depression diagnosis. The evidence review highlighted several limitations. Many of the included studies had methodological flaws, such as inconsistent findings across individual studies and limited generalizability to routine primary care practice. There was also a lack of high-quality evidence for non-counseling interventions, and the trials varied widely in terms of intervention type, duration, and intensity. Additionally, the review noted the absence of data on the ideal timing for initiating preventive interventions and the need for further research on identifying women at increased risk of perinatal depression.","The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that counseling interventions, such as CBT and IPT, provide a moderate net benefit for preventing perinatal depression in women at increased risk. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians provide or refer pregnant and postpartum women at increased risk of perinatal depression to counseling interventions. This recommendation is graded as a ""B,"" indicating that the USPSTF believes the net benefit of these interventions is moderate to substantial. Further research is needed to address gaps in the evidence, particularly regarding the effectiveness of other preventive interventions and the development of accurate risk assessment tools. The review underscores the importance of integrating preventive measures into routine prenatal and postpartum care to mitigate the adverse effects of perinatal depression on mothers and their children. The findings support the continued use of counseling interventions as a primary strategy for preventing perinatal depression, while also highlighting the need for ongoing research to explore additional preventive measures and improve risk identification."
"11 Preventing Maternal Depression in Head Start: Study Protocol The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Problem Solving Education (PSE) in preventing maternal depression among mothers participating in the Head Start program. The study aims to determine whether PSE can reduce the incidence of depressive episodes and improve problem-solving skills, parental functioning, and engagement with mental health services. Maternal depression is a prevalent issue among low-income mothers, particularly those involved in programs like Head Start. Depression in mothers can have adverse effects on both the mothers and their children, leading to poorer developmental outcomes. Despite the high prevalence of depression in this population, access to quality mental health services remains limited. This study seeks to address the gap in preventive mental health interventions for at-risk mothers in the Head Start program. The study plans to enroll 230 Head Start mothers who are at risk for depression but not currently experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE). These participants will be randomized into either the PSE intervention group or the control group, which will receive usual care. This is a community-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in collaboration with Boston University Medical Center and Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD). The trial involves parallel groups, with participants randomized to receive either PSE or standard Head Start services. Both groups will be followed for 12 months to assess the impact of the intervention. Participants will be screened for eligibility based on their depressive symptoms and history of depression. Eligible mothers will be randomized into two groups: one receiving PSE and the other receiving standard care. The PSE intervention consists of six sessions delivered over 8 weeks, focusing on enhancing problem-solving skills and providing support. Data will be collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months using various validated scales, including the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS), Social Problem Solving Inventory (SPSI-R), and Social Adjustment Scale-Self Report (SAS-SR). The primary outcomes of the study include improvement in problem-solving skills, reduction in the incidence rate of moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and decrease in depressive symptoms over time. Secondary outcomes include increased engagement with mental health services, improved parental functioning, and reduced absenteeism of children from Head Start programs. The expected results will be analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis, linear regression, and Poisson regression techniques to compare the intervention and control groups. Potential limitations of the study include the generalizability of the findings, as the study population is specific to Head Start mothers in Boston. There may also be challenges related to participant retention over the 12-month follow-up period. The reliance on self-reported measures could introduce response biases. Additionally, the study's design may not account for all confounding variables that could influence the outcomes.","This study protocol outlines a rigorous approach to evaluating the efficacy of PSE in preventing maternal depression among Head Start mothers. If successful, PSE could provide a scalable and sustainable intervention model for preventing depression in high-risk, low-income populations. The findings could inform future mental health strategies and policies aimed at improving maternal and child health outcomes in similar community settings. The study emphasizes the importance of preventive mental health care and the potential benefits of integrating such interventions into existing community programs like Head Start."
"12 Efficacy of a Maternal Depression Prevention Strategy in Head Start: A Randomized Clinical Trial The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a problem-solving education (PSE) intervention embedded within the Head Start program in preventing depressive symptom episodes among at-risk, low-income mothers. The study aimed to determine whether PSE could improve problem-solving skills and reduce the incidence of depressive symptoms compared to usual Head Start services. Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women, contributing to adverse outcomes for both mothers and their children. Despite the high prevalence of depression among Head Start mothers, there is limited access to mental health services in this population. Embedding effective mental illness prevention strategies in accessible community-based venues like Head Start represents a potentially important public health strategy to address these disparities. The study enrolled 230 mothers who were participants in the Head Start program and at risk for depression, excluding those in a current major depressive episode. Participants were randomized into two groups: 111 to the PSE intervention group and 119 to the usual Head Start services group. This was a parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted from February 2011 through May 2016 at six Head Start agencies serving families at or below the federal poverty level. Participants were followed for 12 months with outcome assessments conducted by masked evaluators. The study design included screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment, aiming to prevent the emergence or worsening of depressive symptoms. Participants were screened for depression risk using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and assessed for eligibility. The PSE intervention consisted of six sessions of cognitive behavioral problem-solving education delivered over 8 weeks. Each session included defining a problem, setting goals, generating solutions, decision-making, implementing solutions, and evaluating outcomes. The primary outcomes measured were problem-solving skills and depressive symptoms, assessed using the Social Problem Solving Inventory (SPSI-R) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS), respectively. Secondary outcomes included the presence of a major depressive episode (MDE) assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. The intention-to-treat analysis among 223 participants found no significant differences in problem-solving skills between the PSE and usual care groups. However, the PSE group had a significantly lower rate of depressive symptom elevations compared to the usual care group. The mean number of depressive symptom elevations was 0.84 in the PSE group versus 1.12 in the usual care group, with an adjusted incident rate ratio (aIRR) of 0.60. Among participants with lower baseline depressive symptoms, PSE was particularly effective, with a mean of 0.39 symptom elevations compared to 0.88 in the usual care group. No significant difference was observed among those with higher baseline depressive symptoms. The study faced several limitations. The sample was predominantly Hispanic, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations. The use of self-reported measures for depressive symptoms and problem-solving skills could introduce response biases. The intervention was delivered by paid study personnel rather than regular Head Start staff, raising questions about the feasibility of replicating the intervention in a real-world setting. Additionally, the study did not include a formal attention control group, and the follow-up period was limited to 12 months, which may not capture long-term effects of the intervention.","The PSE intervention was efficacious in preventing depressive symptom episodes among at-risk, low-income mothers in the Head Start program, particularly for those with lower baseline depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that embedding mental health prevention strategies in community-based settings like Head Start can be an effective public health approach. Further research is needed to test the effectiveness of PSE when delivered by regular Head Start staff and to explore its long-term impact on maternal and child outcomes. The study underscores the potential benefits of integrating preventive mental health interventions into existing community programs to address disparities in mental health care access and outcomes."
"13 Problem-Solving Education to Prevent Depression Among Low-Income Mothers: A Path Mediation Analysis in a Randomized Clinical Trial The primary objective of this study was to understand the mechanism of an efficacious depression prevention intervention, Problem-Solving Education (PSE), among low-income mothers. The study aimed to determine the mediating factors that contribute to the effectiveness of PSE in preventing depressive symptoms. Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women, leading to significant health disparities for both mothers and their children. These women often face barriers to accessing mental health services, exacerbating the issue. While much of the research has focused on treating depression, there is a growing recognition that prevention strategies, particularly those embedded in community settings, are crucial. This study responds to the call for community-based, family-focused interventions by evaluating PSE, a cognitive-behavioral intervention designed for low-income mothers, within the Head Start program. The study enrolled 230 mothers from six Head Start agencies who were at risk for depression but not currently experiencing a major depressive episode. Participants were randomized into two groups: 111 received the PSE intervention, and 119 received usual Head Start services. This study was a multivariate path analysis embedded within a parallel-group randomized efficacy trial. Participants were followed for 12 months with serial assessments of potential intervention mediators and depressive symptoms. The trial adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines and was conducted in a real-world community setting. Participants were screened for depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and were assessed for eligibility. The PSE intervention consisted of six sessions delivered over 8 weeks, focusing on enhancing problem-solving skills and providing support. Usual Head Start services included family needs assessments, home visitation, parenting groups, and referrals to behavioral health services. Data were collected on depressive symptoms, problem-solving ability, mastery, self-esteem, perceived stress, behavioral activation, and coping styles using validated instruments. The primary outcome was the rate of depressive symptom elevations, assessed bimonthly using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS). The study found that participants in the PSE group had significantly lower rates of depressive symptom elevations compared to those receiving usual Head Start services. The mediation analysis revealed that perceived stress was the only factor significantly associated with both PSE participation and depressive symptom outcomes. PSE participants had lower perceived stress change scores, which in turn was associated with a reduced rate of depressive symptom elevations. Although PSE also improved behavioral activation and problem-focused coping, these factors did not significantly mediate the intervention's effect on depressive symptoms. The direct effect of PSE on reducing depressive symptoms was greater than the mediated effect explained by perceived stress alone. The study had several limitations, including its reliance on self-reported measures, which may introduce bias. The sample was predominantly Hispanic, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations. The study did not power specifically to detect mediating effects, and the follow-up period of 12 months may not capture long-term outcomes. Additionally, the intervention was delivered by trained study personnel rather than regular Head Start staff, raising questions about the feasibility of scaling the intervention in typical settings.","The study demonstrated that PSE is an effective intervention for preventing depressive symptoms among low-income mothers, primarily by reducing perceived stress. The findings suggest that PSE's impact on depressive symptoms is partly mediated by stress reduction, highlighting the importance of stress management components in depression prevention interventions. These results support the potential of embedding problem-solving interventions in community-based programs like Head Start to address mental health disparities. Future research should focus on refining the intervention to enhance its effectiveness and exploring its implementation in diverse community settings. Understanding the mechanisms of action can help develop simpler, more scalable intervention strategies that can withstand real-world effectiveness testing and dissemination."
"14 6-Month Outcomes from a Randomized Controlled Trial to Prevent Perinatal Depression in Low-Income Home Visiting Clients The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Mothers and Babies (MB) Course, a group-based cognitive-behavioral intervention, in reducing depressive symptoms and preventing the onset of perinatal depression among low-income women enrolled in home visiting programs. Perinatal depression is a significant public health concern that affects 10-15% of childbearing women, with higher prevalence rates among low-income populations. Maternal depression can lead to adverse outcomes for both mothers and their children, including poor maternal-infant bonding and developmental delays in children. Despite its prevalence, perinatal depression is often under-recognized and undertreated, especially among low-income women. There is a critical need for effective preventive interventions that can be integrated into existing support structures for at-risk populations. The study enrolled 78 women who were either pregnant or had a child less than six months old and were assessed as being at risk for perinatal depression. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the MB intervention (41 participants) or usual home visiting services (37 participants). This study was a randomized controlled trial conducted across four home visiting programs. The trial involved participants being randomized into two groups: one receiving the MB Course and the other receiving standard home visiting services. Depressive symptoms and episodes were assessed at baseline and at 1-week, 3-months, and 6-months post-intervention. Participants were screened for eligibility using the CES-D and Maternal Mood Screener (MMS) to identify those with elevated depressive symptoms or a history of depression without a current episode. The MB Course intervention consisted of six two-hour sessions delivered weekly, focusing on cognitive-behavioral techniques to improve mood management through pleasant activities, positive thinking, and social support. Assessments were conducted using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) for depressive symptoms and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) for depressive episodes. Data were analyzed using mixed effects linear regression to compare changes in depressive symptoms over time between the intervention and control groups. The study found that depressive symptoms declined significantly more in the MB intervention group compared to the usual care group at 1-week, 3-months, and 6-months post-intervention. At the six-month follow-up, 15% of women in the intervention group experienced a major depressive episode compared to 32% in the usual care group, suggesting a trend toward fewer new depressive episodes among those who received the MB intervention. The MB intervention was particularly effective in reducing depressive symptoms, with sustained improvements observed over the six-month period. The study had several limitations, including the absence of an active control condition and the administration of the SCID-I only at the six-month follow-up, which may underestimate the number of new depressive episodes. Additionally, the relatively small sample size limited the ability to study the effects of intervention dosage on outcomes. The study's focus on a specific low-income, predominantly African American population may limit the generalizability of the findings to other groups.","The findings from this randomized controlled trial suggest that the Mothers and Babies (MB) Course is an effective cognitive-behavioral intervention for preventing the worsening of depressive symptoms among low-income perinatal women. The study demonstrated significant reductions in depressive symptoms and a trend toward fewer new depressive episodes in the intervention group, with sustained effects observed at six-months post-intervention. These results highlight the potential of integrating mental health preventive interventions into home visiting programs to address the high rates of depression in this vulnerable population. Future research should focus on larger, more diverse populations and include long-term follow-up assessments to further validate the efficacy of the MB Course and explore its impact on maternal and child health outcomes."
"15 Adaptation of an Evidence-Based Postpartum Depression Intervention: Feasibility and Acceptability of Mothers and Babies 1-on-1 The primary objective of this study was to describe the adaptation of the Mothers and Babies (MB) course from a group format to a one-on-one (MB 1-on-1) modality and to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this adapted intervention among low-income, perinatal women. The study also aimed to assess the implementation of MB 1-on-1 by home visitors and gather feedback from both the home visitors and the clients regarding the intervention. Postpartum depression (PPD) affects a significant proportion of low-income women, with prevalence rates ranging from 10% to 22%. PPD is linked to adverse outcomes such as poor maternal-infant bonding, impaired parenting practices, and negative developmental outcomes for children. Despite the high prevalence, there is a lack of accessible mental health services for low-income women, and stigma often prevents them from seeking help. Traditional group-based interventions for PPD, although effective, face challenges such as insufficient availability of mental health professionals, logistical barriers, and issues with client attendance. This study seeks to address these challenges by adapting the MB course for one-on-one delivery by home visitors in the clients' homes. The study involved 75 home visitors who delivered the MB 1-on-1 intervention to 1-2 clients each. A total of 117 clients completed acceptability surveys, providing data on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. This was a feasibility and acceptability study conducted in partnership with the Illinois Governorâ€™s Office for Early Childhood Development. Home visitors were trained to deliver a 15-session version of the MB 1-on-1 intervention during regular home visits. The study collected quantitative and qualitative data on client enjoyment, comprehension, and perceived usefulness of the intervention, as well as home visitor ratings on the coverage of material, client understanding, and engagement. Home visitors received a day-and-a-half training on the MB 1-on-1 intervention. The intervention was delivered during home visits, with sessions integrated into the visit schedule. Each session focused on different cognitive-behavioral techniques, including behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and increasing social support. Data were collected through surveys administered at the end of each session to both clients and home visitors. Client surveys assessed enjoyment, comprehension, and usefulness, while home visitor surveys evaluated the amount of material covered, client comprehension, and engagement. The results indicated high levels of feasibility and acceptability for the MB 1-on-1 intervention. Home visitors reported that 87.9% of sessions were completely covered and that clients totally understood the material 82.5% of the time. Clients found the sessions enjoyable (82.0% rated them as very enjoyable) and useful (85.1% rated them as very useful). There was some variability in client comprehension and engagement across different modules, with the Pleasant Activities module being the most comprehended and enjoyed. Challenges identified included client distractions during sessions, difficulty completing personal projects, and repetitiveness of the Thoughts module. The study had several limitations, including potential social desirability bias in self-reported data, lack of a control group, and the short-term nature of the feasibility assessment. The sample was limited to home visitors and clients in Illinois, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study relied on self-report measures rather than objective assessments of comprehension and engagement.","The study concluded that the MB 1-on-1 intervention is both feasible and acceptable for delivery by home visitors to low-income, perinatal women. The intervention was well-received by clients and implemented with high fidelity by home visitors. Based on these findings, the MB 1-on-1 intervention shows promise as a scalable and sustainable approach to preventing postpartum depression in at-risk populations. Future research should focus on a more rigorous evaluation of the interventionâ€™s effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms and preventing new depressive episodes, as well as exploring the use of technology to enhance engagement and support."
"16 Adapting a Perinatal Depression Preventive Intervention to Engage an Urban Community The objective of this research was to explore the effectiveness of the Mothers and Babies (MB) Course, which is designed to prevent the onset of perinatal depression among low-income, racially and ethnically diverse women. The problem addressed by the study is the high prevalence of perinatal depression in underserved communities and the need for culturally relevant preventive interventions. Perinatal depression is a significant public health concern that affects maternal and infant outcomes. There is a gap in preventive strategies that effectively engage and serve urban, low-income, and minority populations. The sample size for the study included 110 pregnant women at risk for depression. These participants were recruited from a large urban public health clinic. The study design was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which aimed to compare the adapted MB intervention to usual care provided at the clinic. nan The methods involved adapting the MB course to better fit the cultural and contextual needs of the target population. This adaptation process included input from community stakeholders and potential participants to ensure relevance and acceptability. The intervention consisted of group sessions led by trained facilitators, focusing on cognitive-behavioral strategies and social support to mitigate risk factors associated with perinatal depression. Results indicated that the adapted MB course was feasible and acceptable to participants. Preliminary findings suggested that the intervention had a positive impact on reducing depressive symptoms and improving coping mechanisms among the participants. However, the study also identified challenges in participant retention and engagement, which are critical factors in the effectiveness of community-based interventions. The limitations of the study included the relatively small sample size and the short follow-up period, which may affect the generalizability and long-term impact of the findings. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported measures of depressive symptoms may introduce bias.","In conclusion, the study demonstrates the potential of culturally adapted preventive interventions like the MB course to address perinatal depression in underserved urban communities. Future research should focus on larger-scale implementations, longer follow-up periods, and strategies to enhance participant engagement and retention to fully understand and maximize the benefits of such interventions."
