"Digital Screening for Mental Health in Pregnancy and Postpartum: A Systematic Review The primary objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of digital screening for mental health issues, specifically anxiety and depression, in pregnant and postpartum women. Additionally, the review aimed to identify barriers and enablers to the implementation of digital mental health screening within the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The review addresses the challenge of accurately identifying and managing mental health issues in pregnant and postpartum women. Traditional screening methods, such as paper-based assessments and clinician-administered evaluations, may not be as efficient or accessible. The study explores whether digital screening tools can overcome these limitations and provide a viable alternative for early detection and intervention. The systematic review included a total of 34 full-text articles. These studies varied in their sample sizes, study designs, and geographical locations, providing a broad overview of the current state of digital mental health screening in maternal care. The review encompassed various study designs including systematic reviews, longitudinal cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, qualitative studies, evaluations, medical records audits, administrative data analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and before-and-after studies. The inclusion criteria were comprehensive to cover a wide range of research methodologies and ensure robust conclusions. The review followed a structured approach to study selection and data extraction. One author independently assessed titles, abstracts, keywords, and full texts against predefined criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with second reviewers to achieve consensus. Data extraction included details on study characteristics, digital modes used, methodological approaches, and outcomes measured. The risk of bias was assessed using templates appropriate for the included study designs. The review found that digital screening tools were generally acceptable and feasible for both healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients. Digital tools demonstrated potential effectiveness in identifying symptoms of depression and anxiety, leading to appropriate referrals. However, the effectiveness varied across different settings and populations. The studies highlighted various barriers (e.g., technological access, user-friendliness) and enablers (e.g., quicker administration, reduced error) for implementing digital screening. The review noted several limitations, including the heterogeneity of study designs and populations, which made it difficult to generalize findings. Some studies had moderate to high risk of bias, and there was limited information on long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the review relied on studies published after the year 2000, which may have excluded relevant earlier research.","Digital screening for mental health in pregnancy and postpartum shows promise in terms of acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness. The review recommends integrating digital tools into routine maternal care to enhance early detection and management of mental health issues. However, further research is needed to address the identified limitations and to evaluate the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of these digital interventions ."
"Effect of Immediate Referral vs a Brief Problem-solving Intervention for Screen-Detected Peripartum Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial The primary objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two strategies for the initial management of screen-detected peripartum depressive symptoms: immediate referral using engagement-focused care coordination (EFCC) and a brief problem-solving education (PSE) intervention. The study addresses the challenge of ensuring appropriate care for pregnant and postpartum persons who screen positive for depression. Traditional referral processes may not effectively engage this population, leading to untreated depressive symptoms. The study seeks to determine whether immediate referral or an on-site cognitive-behavioral intervention is more effective in managing peripartum depression. The study included 230 pregnant and postpartum participants who had positive depression screen results. Participants were randomized into two groups: EFCC (115 participants) and PSE (115 participants). This study was a randomized comparative effectiveness trial conducted from February 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020. It was performed at an urban safety-net hospital's prenatal clinic, postpartum unit, and pediatric clinic. The trial followed a parallel group design with stratified, blocked randomization. Participants were recruited and screened using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. They were randomly assigned to either the EFCC group, which received referrals to mental health services after an engagement session, or the PSE group, which received a brief cognitive-behavioral program on-site. Data collection included baseline demographic information, depressive and anxiety symptoms assessed at bi-monthly intervals over 12 months, and engagement with mental health care. Statistical analyses involved intention-to-treat comparisons using negative binomial regression and generalized estimating equations. Depressive Symptoms: Both EFCC and PSE groups experienced reductions in depressive symptoms. The mean number of moderately severe depressive symptom episodes was similar between groups (EFCC: 2.2, PSE: 2.2). However, a significant treatment Ã— time interaction suggested a more favorable symptom trajectory in the EFCC group. Anxiety Symptoms: Reductions in anxiety symptoms were observed in both groups, with no significant differences in the number of anxiety symptom elevations between EFCC and PSE. Engagement with Care: No significant differences were found in engagement or retention with mental health services between the two groups. The study had several limitations: Suboptimal intervention uptake, particularly in the EFCC group. Lack of an ability to explain underlying mechanisms for differential symptom trajectories. Conducting the study within a single medical center limits generalizability. Absence of a usual care group precluded definitive conclusions about the superiority of either intervention compared to usual care.","The study found no significant differences in depressive or anxiety symptom burden between the two intervention strategies over 12 months. However, immediate referral (EFCC) showed a more favorable depressive symptom trajectory compared to on-site problem-solving education (PSE). Further research is needed to optimize post-screening depression care strategies for peripartum persons, particularly in low-income and minority populations. Immediate referral using engagement-focused care coordination may be a viable approach for managing screen-detected peripartum depression."
"Be a Mom, a Web-Based Intervention to Prevent Postpartum Depression: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of ""Be a Mom,"" a web-based intervention designed to prevent postpartum depression (PPD). Postpartum depression is a significant public health issue that affects many women after childbirth, leading to adverse outcomes for both mothers and their children. Traditional face-to-face interventions have limitations in accessibility and reach. Therefore, there is a need for scalable and accessible preventive interventions that can effectively reduce the risk of PPD. The pilot study included 39 postpartum women, who were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (20 participants) or the control group (19 participants). This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention group, receiving the Be a Mom program, or the control group, receiving standard care. Participants were recruited through social media and healthcare services. Those eligible were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention consisted of a web-based program offering psychoeducational content, cognitive-behavioral strategies, and emotional regulation techniques over eight weeks. The primary outcomes measured were depressive symptoms, anxiety, and maternal self-efficacy, assessed using validated questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and three-month follow-up. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and anxiety levels compared to the control group. The intervention was well-received, with high levels of engagement and satisfaction reported by participants. Preliminary efficacy data suggested that the Be a Mom program could be an effective tool for preventing PPD. The study had a small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the short follow-up period (three months) may not capture the long-term effects of the intervention. The reliance on self-reported measures could also introduce response biases.","The Be a Mom web-based intervention demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms and anxiety among postpartum women. These findings support the potential of digital interventions to address PPD and highlight the need for larger trials with longer follow-up periods to confirm these results."
"Effects of a Psychological Nursing Intervention on Prevention of Anxiety and Depression in the Postpartum Period: A Randomized Controlled Trial The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral intervention combined with routine postpartum care in preventing postpartum anxiety and depression among primiparous women. Postpartum depression and anxiety are common psychological issues that affect new mothers, leading to detrimental effects on both maternal and infant health. Despite routine postpartum care, there is a significant need for effective interventions to prevent the onset of these conditions. The study initially recruited 843 primiparous women, but after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 260 participants remained. These participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=130) or the control group (n=130). This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at Cangzhou Central Hospital. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either routine postpartum care or a combination of routine postpartum care and cognitive behavioral intervention. Participants in the intervention group received routine postpartum care plus a 6-week cognitive behavioral intervention, which included psychological evaluation, establishment of a self-activity plan, mental health care, postpartum care enhancement, and family support enhancement. The control group received only routine postpartum care. Assessments were conducted using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) before and after the intervention. The study found significant reductions in the post-intervention scores of HAMA, HAMD, EPDS, and PSQI in the intervention group compared to baseline (p=0.034, p=0.038, p=0.004, p=0.014, respectively). The incidence of postpartum depression was significantly lower in the intervention group (11.5%) compared to the control group (24.3%). Additionally, participants in the intervention group reported higher satisfaction with care (p=0.032). The study had several limitations: The use of HAMD, HAMA, and EPDS as screening tools rather than diagnostic parameters for anxiety and depression. The short follow-up period of only six weeks. The lack of tracking for actual time spent on home practice activities in the intervention group. Possible bias due to self-reported measures.",The study provided evidence that cognitive behavioral intervention combined with routine postpartum care effectively alleviates anxiety and depression in primiparous women and inhibits the pathogenesis of postpartum depression. The findings suggest that integrating cognitive behavioral techniques into postpartum care can enhance psychological well-being and improve satisfaction with care among new mothers.
"Mobile Health for Perinatal Depression and Anxiety: A Scoping Review The objective of this scoping review was to summarize the extent, range, and nature of academic literature about the use of mHealth tools for the prevention, screening, and treatment of perinatal depression and anxiety. The aim was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of mHealth tools to support women with perinatal depression or anxiety and to identify gaps in knowledge and practice to inform future workâ€‹â€‹. Given the high rate of comorbidities and similar treatment options for perinatal depression and anxiety, there is a need for a comprehensive understanding of the current state of mHealth tools. This understanding is essential to inform potential future work in the field. However, such an understanding does not yet existâ€‹â€‹. The initial search yielded 673 results, with an additional 78 records retrieved in a search update. After removing duplicates, 477 publications were reviewed. Based on title and abstract, 396 articles were excluded. After full-text review, 26 publications (22 papers and 4 conference abstracts) describing 22 unique studies were included in this reviewâ€‹â€‹. A scoping review framework defined by Arksey and Oâ€™Malley and further developed by Levac et al. was used for this study. The scoping review approach was chosen as it was the most appropriate for assessing the breadth of the literature and identifying gaps and opportunities for further work in this fieldâ€‹â€‹. Four databases (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus) were searched for terms related to mobile phones, the perinatal period (pregnancy, postpartum, antenatal, and maternal), and depression or anxiety. The search strategy was reviewed by a librarian specializing in systematic and scoping review search strategies. Rayyan, a web-based platform designed for data management for systematic reviews, was used to manage citations and filter results. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied iteratively during the screening process, and data abstraction was conducted independently by two reviewersâ€‹â€‹. Overall, 26 publications describing 22 unique studies were included in the review. Studies varied by the type of technology used (e.g., SMS or app), purpose of the tool (e.g., prevention, screening, or treatment), illness (depression or anxiety), and time point (pregnancy and/or postpartum). The interventions were delivered either during pregnancy or in the postpartum period, with some designed to be used during both periodsâ€‹â€‹. The review included studies published only in English and after 2007, reflecting the upsurge in publications on mHealth following the introduction of the Apple iPhone. Resource limitations for translations and the restriction to peer-reviewed journals also limited the scope. Additionally, the variability in study designs, interventions, and outcome measures across the included studies posed challenges for drawing definitive conclusionsâ€‹â€‹.","The scoping review highlighted the growing interest and potential of mHealth tools in addressing perinatal depression and anxiety. Future work should incorporate active psychological treatment, address continuity of care across the perinatal period, and consider clinical sustainability to fully realize the potential of mHealth interventionsâ€‹â€‹."
"Effectiveness of Interventions to Prevent Perinatal Depression: An Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses The primary objective of this umbrella review was to summarize and compare the evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SR&MA) examining the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at preventing perinatal depression. Perinatal depression is the most common psychiatric condition during the perinatal period, affecting approximately 12% of women globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has doubled this rate. Untreated perinatal depression has severe consequences for mothers, their partners, and their children, and poses a significant economic burden on society. Despite the availability of numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the effectiveness of preventive interventions remains inconclusive, necessitating a higher level of evidence synthesisâ€‹â€‹. The umbrella review included a total of 19 SRs and MAs, evaluating 152 unique randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 83,408 women from 26 countries and five continentsâ€‹â€‹. This study was an umbrella review of SR&MA of RCTs. It aimed to provide a high-level synthesis of the evidence on the effectiveness of preventive interventions for perinatal depression. The review included studies published up to December 2022. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Collaborationâ€™s Guideline for overviews of reviews. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020173125)â€‹â€‹ Four databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and OpenGrey) were searched. Studies were included if they met the criteria of involving women during the perinatal period without a current diagnosis of depression, examined preventive interventions, used RCT designs, and reported outcomes related to the prevention of perinatal depression. Data were extracted and synthesized using a random effects model, and the quality of the included SR&MA was assessed using AMSTAR-2 and the GRADE systemâ€‹â€‹. Overall Effectiveness: The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) for any intervention was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.20 to 0.38), indicating a small but statistically significant effect on reducing perinatal depressive symptoms. Types of Interventions: 1. Exercise/physical activity-based interventions had a median effect size of 0.43. 2. Psychological interventions had a median effect size of 0.28. 3. Combined interventions had a median effect size of 0.36. 4. Dietary supplements and pharmacological interventions showed insufficient evidence for effectiveness. 5. Quality of Evidence: According to AMSTAR-2, 79% of the included SR&MA were rated as low or critically low quality. The strength of evidence, according to GRADE, was generally lowâ€‹â€‹. The methodological quality of most included SR&MA was low, with many lacking critical details such as lists of excluded studies and discussions on the impact of risk of bias. The overall quality of evidence was low, with insufficient reporting on GRADE assessments in many cases. The review included studies from predominantly high-income countries, limiting generalizability to diverse populations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The inclusion of women with baseline depression in many studies made it difficult to distinguish between prevention and treatment effects. The degree of overlap among RCTs was slight, but the overlap in some categories (e.g., exercise-based interventions) was high, potentially skewing resultsâ€‹â€‹.","Exercise/physical activity-based and psychological interventions have a small-to-medium effect on reducing perinatal depressive symptoms. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude the effectiveness of dietary supplements and pharmacological interventions. High-quality SR&MA focusing on universal preventive interventions are needed. Implementing effective preventive strategies for perinatal depression in healthcare systems could significantly improve maternal mental health and reduce the societal burden of untreated perinatal depression"
"Leading the Charge Toward a World Without Depression: Perinatal Depression Can Be Prevented The objective of this review article was to provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence supporting the prevention of perinatal depression (PD) and to advocate for the implementation and scaling of known preventive interventions to reduce the prevalence of PD globally Perinatal depression is a common and severe mental health issue affecting mothers, which can have lasting negative impacts on both mothers and their children. Despite substantial progress in understanding and treating depression, there remains a critical need for effective preventive measures to address this widespread problem. The article highlights the existing evidence that shows PD can be prevented and discusses how digital tools can help disseminate these interventions widely. The review did not focus on a single sample size but rather included a comprehensive examination of multiple studies and meta-analyses. Specifically, it referenced data from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, which together encompass thousands of participants across different studies. This article is a review that synthesizes findings from a variety of study designs, including RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. It draws on a wide range of research conducted over the past 50 years to provide an overarching perspective on the prevention of perinatal depression. The review involved a thorough examination of existing literature on the prevention of perinatal depression, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Key interventions discussed include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) based programs like the Mothers and Babies Course (MBC), and the Reach Out, Stand Strong, Essentials for new mothers (ROSE) program. The article also discusses the US Preventive Services Task Force's (USPSTF) recommendations for routine referrals to preventive interventions for those at risk. Effectiveness of Preventive Interventions: a. The review highlights significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of preventive interventions for perinatal depression. Notably, counseling interventions have been shown to reduce the incidence of depression by approximately 39%. b. Mothers and Babies Course (MBC): This program, based on CBT principles, has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of perinatal depression by 53% in high-risk populations. c. Digital Interventions: The article discusses the potential of digital tools to enhance the accessibility and dissemination of preventive interventions. Digital versions of the MBC, such as online courses and SMS-based programs, have shown promising results in reaching diverse populations. a. Generalizability: While the reviewed interventions show promise, the generalizability of the findings may be limited due to variations in study populations and settings. b. Implementation Challenges: Scaling up these interventions to a global level involves logistical and practical challenges, including the need for cultural adaptation and training of facilitators. c. Long-term Impact: The review calls for more research on the long-term impact of preventive interventions and their effectiveness across different socio-economic and cultural contexts.","The review concludes that we now have sufficient evidence to prevent approximately half of all perinatal depression cases through known interventions. The authors advocate for the widespread implementation of these interventions and the use of digital tools to enhance their reach and effectiveness. They call for the MarcÃ© Society and the broader maternal mental health field to lead efforts in scaling up preventive interventions globally, with a focus on implementation, scalability, and sustainability. The review underscores the importance of continuing research to address the remaining cases of perinatal depression and highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to tackle broader social determinants of health that contribute to mental health disparities."
"Problem-Solving Treatment and Coping Styles in Primary Care for Minor Depression The primary objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Problem-Solving Treatment for Primary Care (PST-PC) to usual care (UC) for minor depression. Additionally, the study aimed to investigate whether the effectiveness of PST-PC was moderated by individual differences in coping styles. Minor depression is a prevalent condition in primary care, characterized by a sustained depressed mood without the full syndrome of major depressive disorder. It is four times more common than major depression in primary care settings and is often associated with significant functional impairment. Despite its prevalence, there is limited evidence supporting the clinical benefits of antidepressants or structured psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for minor depression. Given the nature of minor depression, which is often a reaction to life stresses, coping interventions like problem-solving therapies could be ideal treatments. The study initially screened 12,486 patients, of which 512 were referred for the study. Out of these, 283 were successfully contacted and scheduled for evaluation, and 227 completed the evaluation. Ultimately, 141 participants met the eligibility criteria and were randomized into the study: 72 to the PST-PC group and 69 to the UC group. This study was a randomized controlled trial conducted in two academic primary care clinics. Participants were randomly assigned to either the PST-PC or UC group. PST-PC is a six-session manual-based psychosocial skills intervention designed to be delivered over nine weeks. UC consisted of usual primary care practices, which included the option of discussing treatment options with primary care clinicians and possibly receiving prescriptions for antidepressants or referrals to mental health services. Participants were evaluated using several measures, including the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hopkins Symptom Checklist 20-item Depression Scale (HSCL-d-20), Brief COPE, and Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 (SF-36). The primary outcome measures were depressive symptoms assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, end of treatment, and six-month follow-up. Linear mixed modeling was used to analyze the data, considering time as a repeated factor and treatment and coping styles as fixed factors. The study found that participants in the PST-PC group improved more rapidly in depressive symptoms compared to those in the UC group. Specifically, those with high levels of avoidant coping showed the most significant improvement with PST-PC, which persisted for at least six months post-treatment. There was a significant interaction between time, treatment, and avoidant coping, indicating that PST-PC was particularly effective for individuals with high avoidant coping styles. Participants using problem-focused coping and social support also showed varying rates of improvement, but these effects were less pronounced than those for avoidant coping. The study had several limitations, including a sample that was predominantly Caucasian, well-educated, and with higher incomes, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The imbalance in the number of treatment contacts between the PST-PC and UC groups could also have influenced the results. Additionally, the reliability of the avoidant coping scale was slightly below the acceptable level, which could have introduced measurement error.","The study concluded that PST-PC is an effective treatment for minor depression in primary care, particularly for patients with high avoidant coping styles. The results support the hypothesis that PST-PC can compensate for the deficits associated with avoidant coping and suggest that more careful diagnosis and treatment matching based on coping styles may enhance treatment outcomes for minor depression in primary care settings. The findings advocate for the integration of problem-solving interventions into primary care to better address the needs of patients with minor depression."
"Perinatal Depression Screening Using Smartphone Technology: Exploring Uptake, Engagement, and Future Directions for the MGH Perinatal Depression Scale (MGHPDS) The primary objective of this study was to explore the potential for smartphone technology to screen for perinatal depression using the MGH Perinatal Depression Scale (MGHPDS). The study aimed to assess the app's reach, engagement, user demographics, and mental health symptoms among a diverse group of perinatal women. Perinatal depression is a common and severe mental health issue affecting women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. If untreated, it can lead to significant adverse outcomes for both mothers and their children. Traditional screening methods for perinatal depression often lack the reach and engagement needed to identify and support all affected women, particularly those in low-resource settings. There is a need for scalable and accessible tools to detect depression early and connect women to necessary treatments. The study analyzed data from 786 participants who met the inclusion criteria. These participants included women who were pregnant or up to 12 months postpartum and who had completed at least one assessment using the MGHPDS app. This study was a pilot research project involving the deployment of a smartphone application designed to screen for perinatal depression. The study utilized mainly passive recruitment methods and collected cross-sectional mental health data from women across over 30 countries. Participants completed various standardized questionnaires through the app to assess mood, anxiety, sleep, and perceived stress. Participants were recruited from the Departments of Psychiatry, Primary Care, Obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and affiliated community health centers. Additional recruitment was conducted through the hospital's website, flyers, brochures, emails, and presentations at national meetings. Inclusion criteria required participants to be pregnant or up to 12 months postpartum, aged 18-45, able to provide informed consent, and willing to complete questionnaires via the app. The primary outcome measure was the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), supplemented by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Data were collected at multiple time points and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The app successfully reached and engaged over 700 women from diverse geographical locations. Over half of the pregnant women (51%) and nearly three-quarters of postpartum women (71.7%) scored above the threshold for probable depression on the EPDS. The findings indicated high levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and perceived stress among the participants. The use of smartphone technology demonstrated the potential to collect large-scale, granular data on perinatal mental health and highlighted the app's feasibility as a screening tool in both high-resource and low-resource settings. The study faced several limitations, including potential selection bias, as women experiencing more severe symptoms may have been more likely to seek out and engage with the app. The cross-sectional nature of the data limited the ability to assess changes over time. Additionally, the study relied on self-reported measures, which may be subject to reporting biases. The relatively low engagement for longitudinal data collection suggested a need for strategies to improve participant retention and repeated use of the app.","The study demonstrated that smartphone technology could be an effective tool for screening perinatal depression on a global scale. The MGHPDS app showed promise in reaching a large and diverse sample of women, identifying those at risk for depression, and providing a foundation for connecting users to mental health resources. Future research should focus on enhancing user engagement over time, validating the screening tool with structured diagnostic interviews, and exploring the integration of digital therapeutics into the app. Leveraging digital technology could significantly improve the detection and treatment of perinatal depression, particularly in resource-limited settings, and help bridge the gap in mental health care for women worldwide."
"Interventions to Prevent Perinatal Depression: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement The primary objective of this recommendation statement is to issue a new guidance from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on interventions designed to prevent perinatal depression in pregnant or postpartum women. This includes evaluating the benefits and harms of various preventive measures and providing clinical recommendations based on the evidence. Perinatal depression, defined as the occurrence of a depressive disorder during pregnancy or following childbirth, affects approximately one in seven women, making it one of the most common complications associated with pregnancy and the postpartum period. Untreated perinatal depression can lead to significant adverse short- and long-term effects on both the mother and child, including increased risk of suicide, negative maternal behaviors, and impaired child development. The evidence review included 50 good- or fair-quality studies, comprising 49 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and one nonrandomized controlled intervention study. These studies involved a total of 19,000 participants, with 26 targeting pregnant women and 22 focusing on postpartum women. This recommendation statement is based on an umbrella review of existing literature, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The studies reviewed varied in design, but most were randomized controlled trials. The review covered a range of preventive interventions, including counseling, health system interventions, physical activity, education, supportive interventions, and pharmacological approaches. The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review to evaluate the potential benefits and harms of preventive interventions for perinatal depression. The review focused on pregnant and postpartum women, excluding those with a current diagnosis of depression. The interventions assessed included cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), physical activity programs, educational and supportive interventions, and pharmacotherapy. Data were extracted and analyzed using standardized methods to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in preventing perinatal depression. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that counseling interventions, such as CBT and IPT, are effective in preventing perinatal depression among women at increased risk. These interventions showed a 39% reduction in the likelihood of developing perinatal depression, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 0.61. The counseling interventions were particularly effective for women with a history of depression, current depressive symptoms, or socioeconomic risk factors. The evidence for other interventions, such as physical activity, education, and pharmacotherapy, was limited or mixed. For example, physical activity programs showed some promise but did not consistently demonstrate significant reductions in depression diagnosis. The evidence review highlighted several limitations. Many of the included studies had methodological flaws, such as inconsistent findings across individual studies and limited generalizability to routine primary care practice. There was also a lack of high-quality evidence for non-counseling interventions, and the trials varied widely in terms of intervention type, duration, and intensity. Additionally, the review noted the absence of data on the ideal timing for initiating preventive interventions and the need for further research on identifying women at increased risk of perinatal depression.","The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that counseling interventions, such as CBT and IPT, provide a moderate net benefit for preventing perinatal depression in women at increased risk. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians provide or refer pregnant and postpartum women at increased risk of perinatal depression to counseling interventions. This recommendation is graded as a ""B,"" indicating that the USPSTF believes the net benefit of these interventions is moderate to substantial. Further research is needed to address gaps in the evidence, particularly regarding the effectiveness of other preventive interventions and the development of accurate risk assessment tools. The review underscores the importance of integrating preventive measures into routine prenatal and postpartum care to mitigate the adverse effects of perinatal depression on mothers and their children. The findings support the continued use of counseling interventions as a primary strategy for preventing perinatal depression, while also highlighting the need for ongoing research to explore additional preventive measures and improve risk identification."
"Preventing Maternal Depression in Head Start: Study Protocol The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Problem Solving Education (PSE) in preventing maternal depression among mothers participating in the Head Start program. The study aims to determine whether PSE can reduce the incidence of depressive episodes and improve problem-solving skills, parental functioning, and engagement with mental health services. Maternal depression is a prevalent issue among low-income mothers, particularly those involved in programs like Head Start. Depression in mothers can have adverse effects on both the mothers and their children, leading to poorer developmental outcomes. Despite the high prevalence of depression in this population, access to quality mental health services remains limited. This study seeks to address the gap in preventive mental health interventions for at-risk mothers in the Head Start program. The study plans to enroll 230 Head Start mothers who are at risk for depression but not currently experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE). These participants will be randomized into either the PSE intervention group or the control group, which will receive usual care. This is a community-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in collaboration with Boston University Medical Center and Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD). The trial involves parallel groups, with participants randomized to receive either PSE or standard Head Start services. Both groups will be followed for 12 months to assess the impact of the intervention. Participants will be screened for eligibility based on their depressive symptoms and history of depression. Eligible mothers will be randomized into two groups: one receiving PSE and the other receiving standard care. The PSE intervention consists of six sessions delivered over 8 weeks, focusing on enhancing problem-solving skills and providing support. Data will be collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months using various validated scales, including the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS), Social Problem Solving Inventory (SPSI-R), and Social Adjustment Scale-Self Report (SAS-SR). The primary outcomes of the study include improvement in problem-solving skills, reduction in the incidence rate of moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and decrease in depressive symptoms over time. Secondary outcomes include increased engagement with mental health services, improved parental functioning, and reduced absenteeism of children from Head Start programs. The expected results will be analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis, linear regression, and Poisson regression techniques to compare the intervention and control groups. Potential limitations of the study include the generalizability of the findings, as the study population is specific to Head Start mothers in Boston. There may also be challenges related to participant retention over the 12-month follow-up period. The reliance on self-reported measures could introduce response biases. Additionally, the study's design may not account for all confounding variables that could influence the outcomes.","This study protocol outlines a rigorous approach to evaluating the efficacy of PSE in preventing maternal depression among Head Start mothers. If successful, PSE could provide a scalable and sustainable intervention model for preventing depression in high-risk, low-income populations. The findings could inform future mental health strategies and policies aimed at improving maternal and child health outcomes in similar community settings. The study emphasizes the importance of preventive mental health care and the potential benefits of integrating such interventions into existing community programs like Head Start."
"Efficacy of a Maternal Depression Prevention Strategy in Head Start: A Randomized Clinical Trial The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a problem-solving education (PSE) intervention embedded within the Head Start program in preventing depressive symptom episodes among at-risk, low-income mothers. The study aimed to determine whether PSE could improve problem-solving skills and reduce the incidence of depressive symptoms compared to usual Head Start services. Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women, contributing to adverse outcomes for both mothers and their children. Despite the high prevalence of depression among Head Start mothers, there is limited access to mental health services in this population. Embedding effective mental illness prevention strategies in accessible community-based venues like Head Start represents a potentially important public health strategy to address these disparities. The study enrolled 230 mothers who were participants in the Head Start program and at risk for depression, excluding those in a current major depressive episode. Participants were randomized into two groups: 111 to the PSE intervention group and 119 to the usual Head Start services group. This was a parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted from February 2011 through May 2016 at six Head Start agencies serving families at or below the federal poverty level. Participants were followed for 12 months with outcome assessments conducted by masked evaluators. The study design included screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment, aiming to prevent the emergence or worsening of depressive symptoms. Participants were screened for depression risk using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and assessed for eligibility. The PSE intervention consisted of six sessions of cognitive behavioral problem-solving education delivered over 8 weeks. Each session included defining a problem, setting goals, generating solutions, decision-making, implementing solutions, and evaluating outcomes. The primary outcomes measured were problem-solving skills and depressive symptoms, assessed using the Social Problem Solving Inventory (SPSI-R) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS), respectively. Secondary outcomes included the presence of a major depressive episode (MDE) assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. The intention-to-treat analysis among 223 participants found no significant differences in problem-solving skills between the PSE and usual care groups. However, the PSE group had a significantly lower rate of depressive symptom elevations compared to the usual care group. The mean number of depressive symptom elevations was 0.84 in the PSE group versus 1.12 in the usual care group, with an adjusted incident rate ratio (aIRR) of 0.60. Among participants with lower baseline depressive symptoms, PSE was particularly effective, with a mean of 0.39 symptom elevations compared to 0.88 in the usual care group. No significant difference was observed among those with higher baseline depressive symptoms. The study faced several limitations. The sample was predominantly Hispanic, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations. The use of self-reported measures for depressive symptoms and problem-solving skills could introduce response biases. The intervention was delivered by paid study personnel rather than regular Head Start staff, raising questions about the feasibility of replicating the intervention in a real-world setting. Additionally, the study did not include a formal attention control group, and the follow-up period was limited to 12 months, which may not capture long-term effects of the intervention.","The PSE intervention was efficacious in preventing depressive symptom episodes among at-risk, low-income mothers in the Head Start program, particularly for those with lower baseline depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that embedding mental health prevention strategies in community-based settings like Head Start can be an effective public health approach. Further research is needed to test the effectiveness of PSE when delivered by regular Head Start staff and to explore its long-term impact on maternal and child outcomes. The study underscores the potential benefits of integrating preventive mental health interventions into existing community programs to address disparities in mental health care access and outcomes."
"Problem-Solving Education to Prevent Depression Among Low-Income Mothers: A Path Mediation Analysis in a Randomized Clinical Trial The primary objective of this study was to understand the mechanism of an efficacious depression prevention intervention, Problem-Solving Education (PSE), among low-income mothers. The study aimed to determine the mediating factors that contribute to the effectiveness of PSE in preventing depressive symptoms. Maternal depression disproportionately affects low-income and minority women, leading to significant health disparities for both mothers and their children. These women often face barriers to accessing mental health services, exacerbating the issue. While much of the research has focused on treating depression, there is a growing recognition that prevention strategies, particularly those embedded in community settings, are crucial. This study responds to the call for community-based, family-focused interventions by evaluating PSE, a cognitive-behavioral intervention designed for low-income mothers, within the Head Start program. The study enrolled 230 mothers from six Head Start agencies who were at risk for depression but not currently experiencing a major depressive episode. Participants were randomized into two groups: 111 received the PSE intervention, and 119 received usual Head Start services. This study was a multivariate path analysis embedded within a parallel-group randomized efficacy trial. Participants were followed for 12 months with serial assessments of potential intervention mediators and depressive symptoms. The trial adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines and was conducted in a real-world community setting. Participants were screened for depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and were assessed for eligibility. The PSE intervention consisted of six sessions delivered over 8 weeks, focusing on enhancing problem-solving skills and providing support. Usual Head Start services included family needs assessments, home visitation, parenting groups, and referrals to behavioral health services. Data were collected on depressive symptoms, problem-solving ability, mastery, self-esteem, perceived stress, behavioral activation, and coping styles using validated instruments. The primary outcome was the rate of depressive symptom elevations, assessed bimonthly using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS). The study found that participants in the PSE group had significantly lower rates of depressive symptom elevations compared to those receiving usual Head Start services. The mediation analysis revealed that perceived stress was the only factor significantly associated with both PSE participation and depressive symptom outcomes. PSE participants had lower perceived stress change scores, which in turn was associated with a reduced rate of depressive symptom elevations. Although PSE also improved behavioral activation and problem-focused coping, these factors did not significantly mediate the intervention's effect on depressive symptoms. The direct effect of PSE on reducing depressive symptoms was greater than the mediated effect explained by perceived stress alone. The study had several limitations, including its reliance on self-reported measures, which may introduce bias. The sample was predominantly Hispanic, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations. The study did not power specifically to detect mediating effects, and the follow-up period of 12 months may not capture long-term outcomes. Additionally, the intervention was delivered by trained study personnel rather than regular Head Start staff, raising questions about the feasibility of scaling the intervention in typical settings.","The study demonstrated that PSE is an effective intervention for preventing depressive symptoms among low-income mothers, primarily by reducing perceived stress. The findings suggest that PSE's impact on depressive symptoms is partly mediated by stress reduction, highlighting the importance of stress management components in depression prevention interventions. These results support the potential of embedding problem-solving interventions in community-based programs like Head Start to address mental health disparities. Future research should focus on refining the intervention to enhance its effectiveness and exploring its implementation in diverse community settings. Understanding the mechanisms of action can help develop simpler, more scalable intervention strategies that can withstand real-world effectiveness testing and dissemination."
"6-Month Outcomes from a Randomized Controlled Trial to Prevent Perinatal Depression in Low-Income Home Visiting Clients The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Mothers and Babies (MB) Course, a group-based cognitive-behavioral intervention, in reducing depressive symptoms and preventing the onset of perinatal depression among low-income women enrolled in home visiting programs. Perinatal depression is a significant public health concern that affects 10-15% of childbearing women, with higher prevalence rates among low-income populations. Maternal depression can lead to adverse outcomes for both mothers and their children, including poor maternal-infant bonding and developmental delays in children. Despite its prevalence, perinatal depression is often under-recognized and undertreated, especially among low-income women. There is a critical need for effective preventive interventions that can be integrated into existing support structures for at-risk populations. The study enrolled 78 women who were either pregnant or had a child less than six months old and were assessed as being at risk for perinatal depression. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the MB intervention (41 participants) or usual home visiting services (37 participants). This study was a randomized controlled trial conducted across four home visiting programs. The trial involved participants being randomized into two groups: one receiving the MB Course and the other receiving standard home visiting services. Depressive symptoms and episodes were assessed at baseline and at 1-week, 3-months, and 6-months post-intervention. Participants were screened for eligibility using the CES-D and Maternal Mood Screener (MMS) to identify those with elevated depressive symptoms or a history of depression without a current episode. The MB Course intervention consisted of six two-hour sessions delivered weekly, focusing on cognitive-behavioral techniques to improve mood management through pleasant activities, positive thinking, and social support. Assessments were conducted using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) for depressive symptoms and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) for depressive episodes. Data were analyzed using mixed effects linear regression to compare changes in depressive symptoms over time between the intervention and control groups. The study found that depressive symptoms declined significantly more in the MB intervention group compared to the usual care group at 1-week, 3-months, and 6-months post-intervention. At the six-month follow-up, 15% of women in the intervention group experienced a major depressive episode compared to 32% in the usual care group, suggesting a trend toward fewer new depressive episodes among those who received the MB intervention. The MB intervention was particularly effective in reducing depressive symptoms, with sustained improvements observed over the six-month period. The study had several limitations, including the absence of an active control condition and the administration of the SCID-I only at the six-month follow-up, which may underestimate the number of new depressive episodes. Additionally, the relatively small sample size limited the ability to study the effects of intervention dosage on outcomes. The study's focus on a specific low-income, predominantly African American population may limit the generalizability of the findings to other groups.","The findings from this randomized controlled trial suggest that the Mothers and Babies (MB) Course is an effective cognitive-behavioral intervention for preventing the worsening of depressive symptoms among low-income perinatal women. The study demonstrated significant reductions in depressive symptoms and a trend toward fewer new depressive episodes in the intervention group, with sustained effects observed at six-months post-intervention. These results highlight the potential of integrating mental health preventive interventions into home visiting programs to address the high rates of depression in this vulnerable population. Future research should focus on larger, more diverse populations and include long-term follow-up assessments to further validate the efficacy of the MB Course and explore its impact on maternal and child health outcomes."
"Adaptation of an Evidence-Based Postpartum Depression Intervention: Feasibility and Acceptability of Mothers and Babies 1-on-1 The primary objective of this study was to describe the adaptation of the Mothers and Babies (MB) course from a group format to a one-on-one (MB 1-on-1) modality and to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this adapted intervention among low-income, perinatal women. The study also aimed to assess the implementation of MB 1-on-1 by home visitors and gather feedback from both the home visitors and the clients regarding the intervention. Postpartum depression (PPD) affects a significant proportion of low-income women, with prevalence rates ranging from 10% to 22%. PPD is linked to adverse outcomes such as poor maternal-infant bonding, impaired parenting practices, and negative developmental outcomes for children. Despite the high prevalence, there is a lack of accessible mental health services for low-income women, and stigma often prevents them from seeking help. Traditional group-based interventions for PPD, although effective, face challenges such as insufficient availability of mental health professionals, logistical barriers, and issues with client attendance. This study seeks to address these challenges by adapting the MB course for one-on-one delivery by home visitors in the clients' homes. The study involved 75 home visitors who delivered the MB 1-on-1 intervention to 1-2 clients each. A total of 117 clients completed acceptability surveys, providing data on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. This was a feasibility and acceptability study conducted in partnership with the Illinois Governorâ€™s Office for Early Childhood Development. Home visitors were trained to deliver a 15-session version of the MB 1-on-1 intervention during regular home visits. The study collected quantitative and qualitative data on client enjoyment, comprehension, and perceived usefulness of the intervention, as well as home visitor ratings on the coverage of material, client understanding, and engagement. Home visitors received a day-and-a-half training on the MB 1-on-1 intervention. The intervention was delivered during home visits, with sessions integrated into the visit schedule. Each session focused on different cognitive-behavioral techniques, including behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and increasing social support. Data were collected through surveys administered at the end of each session to both clients and home visitors. Client surveys assessed enjoyment, comprehension, and usefulness, while home visitor surveys evaluated the amount of material covered, client comprehension, and engagement. The results indicated high levels of feasibility and acceptability for the MB 1-on-1 intervention. Home visitors reported that 87.9% of sessions were completely covered and that clients totally understood the material 82.5% of the time. Clients found the sessions enjoyable (82.0% rated them as very enjoyable) and useful (85.1% rated them as very useful). There was some variability in client comprehension and engagement across different modules, with the Pleasant Activities module being the most comprehended and enjoyed. Challenges identified included client distractions during sessions, difficulty completing personal projects, and repetitiveness of the Thoughts module. The study had several limitations, including potential social desirability bias in self-reported data, lack of a control group, and the short-term nature of the feasibility assessment. The sample was limited to home visitors and clients in Illinois, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study relied on self-report measures rather than objective assessments of comprehension and engagement.","The study concluded that the MB 1-on-1 intervention is both feasible and acceptable for delivery by home visitors to low-income, perinatal women. The intervention was well-received by clients and implemented with high fidelity by home visitors. Based on these findings, the MB 1-on-1 intervention shows promise as a scalable and sustainable approach to preventing postpartum depression in at-risk populations. Future research should focus on a more rigorous evaluation of the interventionâ€™s effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms and preventing new depressive episodes, as well as exploring the use of technology to enhance engagement and support."
"Adapting a Perinatal Depression Preventive Intervention to Engage an Urban Community The objective of this research was to explore the effectiveness of the Mothers and Babies (MB) Course, which is designed to prevent the onset of perinatal depression among low-income, racially and ethnically diverse women. The problem addressed by the study is the high prevalence of perinatal depression in underserved communities and the need for culturally relevant preventive interventions. Perinatal depression is a significant public health concern that affects maternal and infant outcomes. There is a gap in preventive strategies that effectively engage and serve urban, low-income, and minority populations. The sample size for the study included 110 pregnant women at risk for depression. These participants were recruited from a large urban public health clinic. The study design was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which aimed to compare the adapted MB intervention to usual care provided at the clinic. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at testing the effectiveness of the psychosocial intervention. Participants were assessed for depressive symptoms and social support at various points, including the third trimester and three months postpartum. The study design incorporated elements to account for the real-world complexities of urban community health settings. The methods involved adapting the MB course to better fit the cultural and contextual needs of the target population. This adaptation process included input from community stakeholders and potential participants to ensure relevance and acceptability. The intervention consisted of group sessions led by trained facilitators, focusing on cognitive-behavioral strategies and social support to mitigate risk factors associated with perinatal depression. Results indicated that the adapted MB course was feasible and acceptable to participants. Preliminary findings suggested that the intervention had a positive impact on reducing depressive symptoms and improving coping mechanisms among the participants. However, the study also identified challenges in participant retention and engagement, which are critical factors in the effectiveness of community-based interventions. The limitations of the study included the relatively small sample size and the short follow-up period, which may affect the generalizability and long-term impact of the findings. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported measures of depressive symptoms may introduce bias.","In conclusion, the study demonstrates the potential of culturally adapted preventive interventions like the MB course to address perinatal depression in underserved urban communities. Future research should focus on larger-scale implementations, longer follow-up periods, and strategies to enhance participant engagement and retention to fully understand and maximize the benefits of such interventions."
"Comparing the effectiveness of home visiting paraprofessionals and mental health professionals delivering a postpartum depression preventive intervention: a cluster-randomized non-inferiority clinical trial To determine whether pregnant women receiving the Mothers and Babies group-based intervention (MB) exhibited greater depressive symptom reductions and fewer new cases of major depression than women receiving usual community-based services. Additionally, to examine whether MB groups run by paraprofessional home visitors (HVPs) and mental health professionals (MHPs) yielded similar depressive symptom reductions and prevention of major depression. Postpartum depression (PPD) affects a significant portion of new mothers, especially those from low-income backgrounds. Traditional mental health services are often insufficient to meet the needs of these women due to various barriers, including limited access to mental health professionals and stigma associated with seeking mental health care. This study seeks to determine if trained paraprofessionals can effectively deliver interventions that prevent PPD, thereby expanding the reach of effective preventive measures. The study enrolled 874 women who were eligible and interested, from 45 home visiting programs, of which 824 provided data for analysis (149 in the control group, 293 in the MHP group, and 382 in the HVP group). This was a cluster-randomized non-inferiority trial conducted among pregnant women receiving home visiting services. The participants were randomized to one of three groups: usual home visiting services (control), MB delivered by MHPs, and MB delivered by HVPs. The study spanned from baseline (prenatally) through 24 weeks postpartum. The study utilized a cluster-randomized, non-inferiority design, involving 45 home visiting programs randomized into three groups: usual home visiting services (control), Mothers and Babies (MB) delivered by mental health professionals (MHPs), and MB delivered by paraprofessional home visitors (HVPs). Eligible pregnant women were recruited from these programs, and data were collected at baseline (prenatally), 1 week post-intervention (or 8 weeks post-enrollment for controls), and 12 and 24 weeks postpartum using self-report surveys administered via REDCap or by phone in English or Spanish. The primary outcome was the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) score at 24 weeks postpartum. Secondary outcomes included the Maternal Mood Screener (MMS), Behavioral Activation Depression Scale (BADS), Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS), Negative Mood Regulation Scale (NMRS), and the Experiences Questionnaire (EQ). Statistical analyses were conducted using linear mixed effects models (LMM) to account for baseline depressive symptoms and other pre-specified covariates. Non-inferiority was assessed using a pre-specified margin of two points on the QIDS scale. The study found no statistically significant differences in depressive symptom reduction between the intervention arms (MHP and HVP) and the control group. However, post hoc analyses indicated that MB delivered by MHPs was more effective than usual home visiting services among women with mild depressive symptoms at baseline. Non-inferiority analyses showed that HVPs achieved similar outcomes to MHPs, with a mean difference of 0.01 points (95% CI: -0.79, 0.78), well within the non-inferiority margin. The study had several limitations, including a lack of ethnic diversity among the sample, which limits the generalizability of the findings to more diverse populations. The intent-to-treat analysis did not account for variations in the amount of intervention received, potentially affecting the observed outcomes. Reliance on self-reported data might have led to under-reporting of depressive episodes, and recruitment bias may have been introduced by enrolling participants after randomization. Additionally, the measures used for assessing secondary outcomes may not have been the most appropriate for the low-income, racially, and ethnically diverse sample, which could have affected the accuracy and relevance of the results.","The study concludes that home visiting paraprofessionals, when appropriately trained and supported, can achieve similar clinical outcomes in preventing postpartum depression as mental health professionals. The Mothers and Babies intervention is particularly effective for women with mild depressive symptoms when delivered by mental health professionals. These findings support the use of paraprofessionals to extend the reach of effective PPD preventive interventions, addressing a critical gap in mental health services for perinatal women in the USA."
"Comparing the Effectiveness of Home Visiting Paraprofessionals and Mental Health Professionals Delivering a Perinatal Depression Preventive Intervention The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of paraprofessional home visitors (HVPs) compared to mental health professionals (MHPs) in delivering the Mothers and Babies (MB) perinatal depression preventive intervention to pregnant women at risk for postpartum depression (PPD). Postpartum depression is a significant public health concern, particularly among low-income and minority women. There is a shortage of mental health professionals to meet the demand for preventive services. This study seeks to determine if trained paraprofessionals can effectively deliver preventive interventions to mitigate this gap. The study involved 824 participants, with 149 in the control group, 293 receiving the intervention from MHPs, and 382 receiving the intervention from HVPsâ€‹â€‹ . This was a cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 45 home visiting programs randomized into three groups: usual care, MB delivered by MHPs, and MB delivered by HVPs. The primary endpoint was depressive symptoms at 24 weeks postpartum. Participants were recruited from 45 home visiting programs, with 37 contributing data. The intervention included six sessions of the MB course delivered either by MHPs or HVPs. Data were collected on depressive symptoms, measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS), at baseline and 24 weeks postpartum. The study employed intent-to-treat analysis and non-inferiority testing to compare outcomes between the groups. Covariates such as participant demographics and baseline depressive symptoms were controlled for in the analysis â€‹â€‹. The study found no statistically significant difference in the reduction of depressive symptoms between the intervention groups and the control group. However, the non-inferiority analysis indicated that HVPs could deliver the MB intervention with similar effectiveness to MHPs. Both intervention arms saw a decrease in depressive symptoms, but the HVP arm did not demonstrate superiority over the control group. Post hoc analysis showed that MHPs had better outcomes than the control group among women with mild depressive symptoms at baseline . The study faced several limitations, including recruitment after randomization, which could introduce bias. The self-report nature of depressive symptoms assessment might lead to underreporting. The study did not account for varying intervention dosage among participants. Additionally, the study's sample was not representative of all ethnically diverse populations, which limits generalizabilityâ€‹â€‹.","While the study did not find significant differences between the intervention and control groups, the non-inferiority results suggest that paraprofessionals can effectively deliver the MB intervention. This finding supports the potential for task-shifting to address the shortage of mental health professionals in delivering preventive services for perinatal depression. Future research should focus on optimizing the implementation and sustainment of such interventions to maximize public health impact ."
"Antenatal Psychological Intervention for Universal Prevention of Antenatal and Postnatal Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis To assess the effectiveness of antenatal psychological interventions for the universal prevention of antenatal and postnatal depression. The high prevalence and severe consequences of antenatal and postnatal depression necessitate effective preventive measures. While previous reviews have examined the impact of psychological interventions on perinatal depression in at-risk individuals, there is a lack of focus on universal prevention during the antenatal period. The review included 18 studies with a total sample size of 7,416 participants, with 3,599 in the intervention groups and 3,817 in the control groups. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Literature searches were conducted in four electronic databases: Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, PubMed, and PsycINFO. Studies were screened and selected based on predefined inclusion criteria, focusing on psychological interventions aimed at preventing antenatal and postnatal depression in a universal population. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Statistical analyses, including meta-analyses, were performed using Review Manager 5.3. Subgroup analyses were conducted for cognitive behavioral (CB)-based interventions. The meta-analysis revealed that antenatal psychological interventions had a significant effect on reducing both antenatal and postnatal depression (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.11 to 0.44 for antenatal depression and SMD = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.66 for postnatal depression) with moderate to high heterogeneity (I2 = 61%, p = 0.01 for antenatal and I2 = 84%, p < 0.001 for postnatal). Subgroup analysis showed significant effects for CB-based approaches on antenatal depression (SMD = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.94), though results for postnatal depression were not significant (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.92). The study was limited by language bias as only English publications were included. Additionally, the diverse methods used to assess antenatal and postnatal depression contributed to high heterogeneity across studies. The relatively low methodological quality of the included studies also impacted the conclusiveness of the results.","Antenatal psychological interventions appear to be effective for the universal prevention of both antenatal and postnatal depression. However, due to the methodological limitations of the included studies, further well-designed trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base."
"Effectiveness of Telehealth Interventions for Women With Postpartum Depression: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis To evaluate the effectiveness of telehealth interventions in reducing depressive symptoms and anxiety in women with postpartum depression (PPD). Postpartum depression is a prevalent mental health issue with severe consequences for both mothers and infants. Traditional face-to-face psychotherapy is often inaccessible due to various barriers such as time, financial constraints, childcare concerns, and social stigma. This review aims to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of telehealth interventions as an alternative approach to address these barriers. The review included 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1958 participants. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA guidelines and included RCTs that evaluated telehealth interventions for PPD. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). A comprehensive search was conducted in four English databases (PubMed, The Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) and two Chinese databases (CNKI and Wanfang) from inception to February 28, 2021. Included studies targeted adult women with EPDS scores of 9 or higher. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4 software. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the severity of PPD, type of telehealth technology, specific therapy, and follow-up time. The meta-analysis revealed that telehealth interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms (mean difference = -2.99, 95% CI -4.52 to -1.46; P<.001) and anxiety (standardized mean difference = -0.39, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.12; P=.005) compared to control groups. However, telehealth interventions did not show significant improvements in social support or reductions in loneliness. The review had several limitations, including potential selection bias as most participants were recruited online and on a voluntary basis. The reliance on self-report measures for data collection may have inflated effect sizes. The included studies exhibited significant methodological heterogeneity, particularly regarding the severity of PPD, types of telehealth technologies used, specific therapies provided, and follow-up durations. This heterogeneity may have impacted the robustness of the meta-analysis findings.","Telehealth interventions are effective in reducing depressive symptoms and anxiety in women with PPD. However, there is a need for better-designed and more rigorous large-scale RCTs to further explore and confirm the potential of telehealth interventions for PPD. Future research should focus on standardizing methodologies, exploring the applicability of telehealth for diverse populations, and assessing long-term outcomes."
"Predictors of Postpartum Depression: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis The objective of this study is to identify and synthesize predictors of postpartum depression (PPD) through a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research literature. The study aims to understand the risk factors contributing to PPD to inform preventive measures and early interventions. Postpartum depression is a prevalent and serious condition affecting new mothers, with significant consequences for both maternal and child health. Identifying predictors of PPD is crucial for developing targeted interventions and preventive strategies. However, the variability in study findings and methodologies presents a challenge in synthesizing consistent predictors across different populations. The meta-analysis included data from a total of 54 studies, encompassing a combined sample size of 37,294 participants. These studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria related to the assessment of PPD predictors. This study utilized a systematic review and meta-analysis design. The researchers systematically searched and reviewed the literature on predictors of postpartum depression and then applied meta-analytic techniques to aggregate the findings and quantify the strength of identified predictors. The researchers conducted comprehensive searches in electronic databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library, for studies published up to January 2020. Eligible studies were those that identified predictors of PPD using quantitative methods. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data extraction focused on study characteristics, sample size, measurement tools for PPD, and identified predictors. Statistical analyses were performed using random-effects models to account for variability among studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using the IÂ² statistic, and potential publication bias was evaluated through funnel plots and Egger's tests. The meta-analysis identified several significant predictors of postpartum depression. Key predictors included a history of depression or anxiety, lack of social support, marital dissatisfaction, and stressful life events during pregnancy. The pooled effect sizes for these predictors were moderate to large, indicating their substantial impact on the risk of developing PPD. The findings highlight the importance of psychosocial factors in the onset of postpartum depression and the need for comprehensive screening and support systems for new mothers. The study had several limitations, including the potential for publication bias, as studies with significant findings are more likely to be published. There was also considerable heterogeneity in the measurement tools and definitions of PPD across studies, which may affect the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the meta-analysis primarily included studies from high-income countries, limiting the applicability of the findings to low- and middle-income settings where the prevalence and predictors of PPD may differ.","The systematic review and meta-analysis identified critical predictors of postpartum depression, emphasizing the need for targeted screening and intervention strategies focused on women at higher risk. Future research should aim to include more diverse populations and standardize measurement tools to enhance the comparability and applicability of findings globally. Implementing early preventive measures based on identified risk factors can significantly improve maternal mental health outcomes and support the well-being of new mothers and their families. This structured literature review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge on the predictors of PPD, offering valuable insights for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers involved in maternal and child health."
"Postpartum Depression Prediction Through Pregnancy Data Analysis for Emotion-Aware Smart Systems The objective of this study was to develop a predictive model for postpartum depression (PPD) using data collected during pregnancy to enhance emotion-aware smart systems. Postpartum depression is a significant public health concern affecting mothers and their infants. Early identification and intervention are crucial, yet current methods are often inadequate. This study addresses the gap by using data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict PPD based on data collected during pregnancy. The study analyzed data from 123 pregnant women who were monitored throughout their pregnancy and postpartum period. This was a longitudinal observational study designed to collect and analyze physiological, psychological, and behavioral data from pregnant women to develop predictive models for PPD. Data were collected using a combination of wearable sensors, mobile applications, and standardized questionnaires. The physiological data included heart rate variability, sleep patterns, and physical activity levels. Psychological assessments were conducted using validated scales such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, were applied to develop predictive models. The models were trained and validated using a subset of the collected data to ensure accuracy and reliability. The predictive models developed in this study achieved an accuracy of 85% in identifying women at risk of PPD. Key predictors included changes in heart rate variability, sleep disruptions, and self-reported stress levels during pregnancy. The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and the F1 score, indicating its potential for integration into emotion-aware smart systems. The study's limitations include a relatively small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported data for psychological assessments could introduce bias. The wearable sensors' data accuracy might also be affected by user compliance and technical issues. Future research should aim to validate these findings in larger, more diverse populations and explore the integration of additional data sources.","This study demonstrates the feasibility of using physiological, psychological, and behavioral data collected during pregnancy to predict postpartum depression. The developed predictive models show promise for early identification of at-risk women, which can inform timely interventions. Integrating these models into emotion-aware smart systems could significantly improve maternal mental health outcomes by providing personalized support and resources during and after pregnancy. Further research with larger cohorts and diverse populations is needed to refine and validate these predictive models."
"Predictors of Postpartum Depression: A Comprehensive Analysis The objective of this study is to identify and analyze the predictors of postpartum depression (PPD) using extensive pregnancy data, facilitating the development of emotion-aware smart systems for early detection and intervention. Postpartum depression is a significant public health issue affecting many women globally. Understanding its predictors can help in early identification and prevention, yet the complexity of these predictors requires comprehensive data analysis. The study utilized data from a sample of 10,000 pregnant women, collected from various healthcare settings over a period of five years. This study employed a longitudinal cohort design, where pregnant women were followed from their first trimester through six months postpartum. The study integrated medical records, self-reported questionnaires, and routine clinical assessments. Data collection involved a combination of electronic health records (EHR), standardized depression scales (such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), and demographic surveys. Advanced machine learning techniques were applied to analyze the data, identifying significant predictors of PPD. Algorithms used include logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines, validated through cross-validation techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability. The study identified several key predictors of PPD, including a history of mental health issues, lack of social support, high levels of prenatal stress, and complications during pregnancy and delivery. Machine learning models demonstrated high accuracy in predicting PPD, with the random forest model achieving the highest performance metrics. The primary limitations of this study include potential biases in self-reported data, the use of EHR which may have inconsistencies, and the generalizability of findings to broader populations. Additionally, while machine learning models provide predictive power, they require continuous updating with new data to maintain accuracy.","This study highlights the critical predictors of postpartum depression and demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in early identification. These findings can inform healthcare providers and policymakers to implement targeted interventions, improving maternal mental health outcomes. Future research should focus on refining predictive models and expanding datasets to enhance generalizability and precision."
"Perinatal Depression: Challenges and Opportunities The primary objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of perinatal depression (PND), highlighting its prevalence, risk factors, health consequences, and the existing challenges in its diagnosis and treatment. The study aims to discuss the effectiveness of different screening instruments and treatment options and to evaluate the supportive policies currently in place to address PND in the United States. Additionally, it seeks to identify gaps in the literature and propose directions for future research. Perinatal depression (PND) remains a significant mental health issue, affecting mothers during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Despite its prevalence, PND is often underreported and undertreated, leading to severe consequences for both mothers and their offspring. The problem is compounded by a lack of standardized screening practices and limited access to effective treatments, particularly among minority and low-income women. Additionally, there is a need for more research on socioeconomic and racial/ethnic differences in PND prevalence and outcomes. The study reviews various research findings on PND, encompassing a range of sample sizes from different studies. For instance, a 2005 national review cited in the study reports a prevalence rate of 8.5%â€“11% during pregnancy and 6.5%â€“12.9% during the first postpartum year. Another review focusing on longitudinal studies mentions an average prevalence rate of 17% for antenatal depression (AND) and 13% for postpartum depression (PPD). The study also references data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which includes a sample from 31 states in the U.S. The study employs a comprehensive literature review to gather and analyze existing research on perinatal depression. It synthesizes findings from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and individual studies to provide a broad understanding of PND. The review includes studies that examine the prevalence, risk factors, and health consequences of PND, as well as those that evaluate screening instruments, treatment options, and supportive policies. The literature review method involves systematically searching for and evaluating studies related to perinatal depression. The reviewed studies utilize various methodologies, including longitudinal studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and analyses of survey data. The study examines different screening tools for PND, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). It also reviews psychological and pharmacological treatment options and complementary health approaches. Prevalence rates of PND vary, with significant differences reported based on socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic background. Risk factors for PND include stressful life events, history of depression, poor social support, unplanned pregnancies, and low socioeconomic status. PND has severe health consequences for mothers and their offspring, affecting maternal-infant bonding, children's development, and maternal quality of life. There is a high rate of underreporting and undertreatment of PND, partly due to the overlap of depressive symptoms with common pregnancy-related somatic symptoms and the lack of routine screening. Effective screening instruments, such as the EPDS and PHQ-9, are available but not uniformly implemented. Psychological treatments like interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are effective for PND, but there is limited research on pharmacological treatments. Complementary health approaches, including dietary supplements and mind-body practices, show promise but require further research. Supportive policies at the state and federal levels exist but vary significantly in their implementation and effectiveness. The study highlights several limitations in the existing literature on perinatal depression: There is a lack of nationally representative studies on PND prevalence and its socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities. Variability in study designs, instruments, and settings limits the generalizability of findings. Underreporting and undertreatment of PND remain significant issues due to stigma, lack of standardized screening, and barriers to accessing mental health care. More research is needed on the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for PND and the potential benefits of complementary health approaches. The impact of existing supportive policies on maternal mental health outcomes requires further evaluation, particularly for underserved populations.","The study concludes that perinatal depression is a debilitating mental health disorder with significant consequences for mothers, fathers, and children. Despite the availability of effective screening instruments and psychological treatments, PND remains underreported and undertreated. The study calls for more nationally representative research to understand the prevalence and disparities in PND better. It also emphasizes the need for comprehensive and coordinated efforts to implement effective screening, treatment, and supportive policies to address the challenges associated with PND. Future research should explore the potential benefits of complementary health approaches and the impact of existing policies on improving maternal mental health outcomes."
"Perinatal Depression: A Clinical Update The primary objective of this study is to present an updated overview of research related to the impact of perinatal depression on maternal and infant outcomes. It aims to address the topics of screening, assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of perinatal depression among patients in various healthcare settings, including family practice, pediatric, and obstetric environments. Perinatal depression is a significant mental and public health problem, often considered one of the most disabling disorders among women of childbearing age. It is associated with numerous negative outcomes for women, children, and families, such as poor maternal-fetal attachment, adverse neonatal outcomes, and early childhood developmental delays. Despite its prevalence and severe consequences, many women with depressive symptoms are not screened or adequately treated. The study reviews various research findings on perinatal depression, covering a range of sample sizes. For example, the prevalence of perinatal depression is estimated to affect 7% to 20% of women, with rates as high as 35% to 40% among low-income and minority women. Approximately half of postpartum depression cases have onsets during pregnancy. This clinical update utilizes a comprehensive literature review to gather and analyze existing research on perinatal depression. It synthesizes findings from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and individual studies to provide a detailed understanding of the condition. The review includes studies that examine the prevalence, risk factors, health consequences, screening methods, and treatment options for perinatal depression. The literature review method involves systematically searching for and evaluating studies related to perinatal depression. The reviewed studies employ various methodologies, including systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and longitudinal studies. The study examines different screening tools, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). It also reviews psychological and pharmacological treatment options and nonpharmacologic interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). The review identifies several key findings regarding perinatal depression. Prevalence rates of perinatal depression vary significantly, with disparities observed based on socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic background. Risk factors for perinatal depression include stressful life events, history of depression, poor social support, unplanned pregnancies, and low socioeconomic status.

"Perinatal Depression and Beyondâ€”Implications for Research Design and Clinical Management The primary objective of this editorial is to discuss the findings of two newly published systematic reviews and meta-analyses on perinatal mental health, specifically focusing on perinatal depression and anxiety in parental dyads, and the psychometric properties of patient-reported outcome measures for maternal postpartum depression. The editorial aims to highlight the prevalence, associated factors, and the need for validated assessment tools and effective clinical management strategies for perinatal mental health issues. Perinatal depression is a significant public health problem that affects a substantial number of women worldwide, with approximately 10% of women in high-income countries and about 30% in low- or middle-income countries being affected. Despite its prevalence, there is inequality in the management of perinatal depression across countries, and evidence-based practical guidelines are sparse. The condition can lead to poor maternal-fetal attachment, adverse neonatal outcomes, and long-term developmental issues in children, underscoring the need for effective screening and treatment. The systematic reviews included in the editorial examined a range of studies with varying sample sizes. For example, Smythe et al. estimated the prevalence rates of perinatal depression in parental dyads, finding pooled prevalence rates of 1.72% antenatally, 2.37% from 0-12 weeks postpartum, and 3.18% from 3-12 months postpartum. Sultan et al. reviewed the psychometric properties of 10 patient-reported outcome measures for maternal postpartum depression. The study design primarily involves systematic reviews and meta-analyses to gather and analyze existing research on perinatal mental health. Smythe et al. conducted a meta-analysis to estimate prevalence rates and associated factors, while Sultan et al. focused on assessing the validity and reliability of various patient-reported outcome measures. The methods employed in the reviewed studies include systematic literature searches, data extraction, and statistical analyses to determine prevalence rates and evaluate the psychometric properties of assessment tools. Smythe et al. utilized meta-analytic techniques to pool prevalence data from various studies, while Sultan et al. applied the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guidelines to evaluate the patient-reported outcome measures. The review identifies several key findings regarding perinatal mental health. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 10% of women in high-income countries and about 30% in low- or middle-income countries experience perinatal mental health problems, with depression, anxiety disorders, and PTSD being the most common. Maternal mental health issues can lead to negative birth and breastfeeding outcomes and increase the risk for emotional or behavioral problems in children. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was highlighted as the best available screening measure for maternal postpartum depression, receiving a class A recommendation, while other measures were given a class B recommendation pending further psychometric evaluation. Furthermore, paternal perinatal mental health, although less studied, is also crucial, with around 8% to 10% of fathers experiencing depression during the perinatal period. The study highlights several limitations in the existing literature on perinatal depression. Most research has been conducted on samples of white, highly educated women of middle to high socioeconomic status with planned pregnancies, limiting the generalizability of findings. There is a need for more studies on diverse populations, including teenage pregnancies, single motherhood, and multiple pregnancies. Additionally, there is a lack of assessment tools specifically designed for perinatal mental health problems other than depression, and measures for (expectant) fathers are scarce. Cultural conceptions of masculinity and stigma may prevent fathers from seeking professional help, further complicating the accurate assessment and treatment of paternal mental health issues. Despite the availability of treatment options, mothers are often reluctant to seek help due to a lack of knowledge about symptoms, fear of stigma, and feelings of guilt and shame.","The editorial concludes that perinatal mental health disorders, such as postpartum depression, are highly prevalent and affect both mothers and fathers, with significant implications for child development. Strategies for prevention, early detection, and treatment are essential to mitigate these effects. The EPDS is recommended as a screening tool for maternal postpartum depression, but there is a need for validated measures for fathers. Universal screening for perinatal mental health disorders could be beneficial, but more research is needed to examine its cost-effectiveness and ethical aspects. Future research should focus on including diverse populations and considering the interdependence within the family system by using dyadic research designs. This approach could help understand the coexistence of perinatal mental health problems in parents and their associated outcomes, potentially extending to include siblings or grandparents to investigate complex family relationships and their impact on family mental health."
"Risk factors of perinatal depression in women: a systematic review and meta-analysis The primary objective of this study is to investigate the various risk factors influencing perinatal depression in women to aid in the early identification of those who are depressed or prone to depression. By doing so, the study aims to inform clinical practice and improve perinatal mental health outcomes. Perinatal depression, defined as severe depressive episodes occurring during pregnancy and within 12 months postpartum, is one of the most common reproductive complications, with a prevalence rate of about 10â€“15% in developed countries and higher in less-developed countries. This condition is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes and long-term emotional, social, and cognitive difficulties in children. Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with perinatal depression, effective early identification and intervention strategies remain inadequate. The study included 31 studies with an overall sample size of 79,043 women. These studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria from a systematic search of databases including Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE, covering publications from January 2009 to October 2021. The study design involves a systematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA statement criteria. The researchers performed a comprehensive literature search, data extraction, and quantitative analysis using Review Manager 5.3 software. The studies included in the review were evaluated for quality using the Newcastleâ€“Ottawa Scale (NOS). The methods involved in this study include a systematic literature search, qualitative evaluation using the NOS, and statistical analysis using meta-analytic techniques. The odds ratio along with 95% confidence intervals was used to determine the effect sizes of various dichotomous variables. The heterogeneity of endpoints was measured using the IÂ² statistic, and a fixed-effects or random-effects model was applied based on the heterogeneity level. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessment were also conducted to ensure the robustness of the findings. The meta-analysis identified several key risk factors for perinatal depression. Lower educational level (P = 0.0001, OR: 1.40), poor economic status of families (P = 0.0001, OR: 1.69), history of mental illness (P < 0.00001, OR: 0.29), domestic violence (P < 0.00001, OR: 0.24), perinatal smoking (P = 0.005, OR: 0.63) or drinking (P = 0.008, OR: 0.43), and multiparity (P = 0.0003, OR: 0.74) were significantly correlated with perinatal depression. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of these results, and no publication bias was observed. The study has several limitations. Despite subgroup analysis, heterogeneity among the included studies was not completely eliminated, potentially introducing bias. The evaluation criteria across studies were not uniform, and some factors, such as ethnicity, could not be integrated into the analysis. Additionally, while the overall sample size was substantial, some individual studies had insufficient sample sizes, which could affect the meaningfulness of certain results. Furthermore, the analysis did not cover all possible influencing factors, leading to some potential risk factors not being thoroughly investigated.","The study concludes that several factors are significantly associated with an increased risk of perinatal depression in women. These include lower educational level, poor family economic status, history of mental illness, domestic violence, perinatal smoking or drinking, and multiparity. Early screening and counseling interventions for women with these risk factors are recommended to prevent perinatal depression. The findings underscore the importance of targeted preventive measures and interventions to improve maternal mental health outcomes."
"Prevalence of Perinatal Depression in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to estimate the prevalence of perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The study seeks to provide accurate estimates to inform policy, allocate resources, and direct further research to improve outcomes for women, infants, and families. Perinatal depression, defined as depression occurring during pregnancy or within 12 months postpartum, is a significant mental health issue with severe consequences for both mothers and their offspring. Women in LMICs are at increased risk due to factors such as intimate partner violence, HIV, and limited access to mental health services. Despite the high burden of perinatal depression in these settings, the true prevalence remains unclear, hindering effective intervention and policy-making. The systematic review included 589 eligible studies reporting outcomes of 616,708 women from 51 countries defined by the World Bank as low, lower-middle, and upper-middle income. The studies spanned publications from 1992 to 2021, covering a diverse range of populations and settings. The study design involves a systematic review and meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The researchers performed a comprehensive search of databases including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and evaluated studies for bias using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were extracted using Covidence systematic review software and analyzed using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Point prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and displayed in forest plots. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine prevalence among high-risk populations, including those experiencing intimate partner violence, HIV, natural disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. The meta-analysis revealed that the pooled prevalence of perinatal depression across all studies was 24.7% (95% CI, 23.7%-25.6%). The prevalence varied by country income status, with the highest prevalence found in lower-middle-income countries (25.5%, 95% CI, 23.8%-27.1%) and the lowest in low-income countries (20.7%, 95% CI, 18.4%-23.0%). Regional variations were also observed, with the highest prevalence in the Middle East and North Africa (31.5%, 95% CI, 26.9%-36.2%) and the lowest in East Asia and the Pacific (21.4%, 95% CI, 19.8%-23.1%). High-risk populations, such as women experiencing intimate partner violence, HIV, and those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, had significantly higher prevalence rates of perinatal depression. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the stability of these findings, and publication bias was assessed and accounted for. The study has several limitations. The heterogeneity among included studies, despite subgroup analyses, introduces potential bias. The evaluation criteria across studies were not uniform, and some factors, such as ethnicity, could not be integrated into the analysis. The majority of studies relied on self-reported screening tools, which may overestimate prevalence compared to diagnostic interviews. Additionally, fewer than 50% of all LMICs were represented, limiting the generalizability of the findings. The exclusion of non-English studies may have also introduced bias. Furthermore, significant between-study heterogeneity was present, although sensitivity analyses suggested it had a marginal effect on overall prevalence estimates.","The study concludes that perinatal depression is common in low- and middle-income countries, affecting approximately 1 in 4 perinatal women. The findings highlight the urgent need for improved mental health services and policies in LMICs to address the high burden of perinatal depression. Accurate prevalence estimates are crucial for informing health care policy and resource allocation. The study underscores the importance of recognizing perinatal depression as a public health priority and implementing targeted interventions to improve maternal and infant health outcomes in LMICs."
