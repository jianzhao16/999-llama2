User: what is the recipe of mayonnaise?

> Assistant: The classic condiment! Mayonnaise is a thick, creamy sauce made from a combination of oil, egg yolks, acid (such as vinegar or lemon juice), and seasonings. Here's a simple recipe to make mayonnaise at home:

**Ingredients:**

* 2 egg yolks
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar (such as white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar)
* 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup (240 ml) neutral-tasting oil, such as canola, grapeseed, or vegetable oil
* Water (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Start with room temperature ingredients**: This is important to ensure that the mixture emulsifies properly.
2. **Whisk together the egg yolks, lemon juice, mustard (if using), and salt**: In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, lemon juice, mustard (if using), and salt until well combined.
3. **Slowly add the oil**: While continuously whisking the egg yolk mixture, slowly pour in the oil in a thin, steady stream. Start with a slow trickle and gradually increase the flow as the mixture thickens.
4. **Emulsify the mixture**: Continue whisking until the mixture thickens and emulsifies, which should take about 5-7 minutes. You'll know it's ready when the mixture has doubled in volume and has a thick, creamy consistency.
5. **Taste and adjust**: Taste the mayonnaise and adjust the seasoning as needed. If it's too thick, add a small amount of water. If it's too thin, add a little more oil.
6. **Store the mayonnaise**: Transfer the mayonnaise to an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

**Tips and Variations:**

* Use a neutral-tasting oil to avoid flavoring the mayonnaise.
* If you're having trouble getting the mixture to emulsify, try adding a small amount of warm water or lemon juice to help it along.
* For a lighter mayonnaise, use less oil or add a little more lemon juice.
* For a spicy mayonnaise, add a pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes.
* For a flavored mayonnaise, try adding minced garlic, chopped
